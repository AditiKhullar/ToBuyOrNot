('Processing text: ', '[Because of the way BOY, SNOW, BIRD is structured, it\'s difficult to discuss the novel without giving away plot points that emerge around the halfway point. This review won\'t reveal anything that isn\'t discussed in the cover copy or implicit in the mythic structure, but readers who want to come to the novel not knowing anything should stop here, with my strong recommendation for this novel about identity and the ambiguities of race, gender, and family life.]\n\nThe title of Helen Oyeyemi\'s excellent new novel derives from the names of its three female protagonists. Boy is Boy Novak, who escapes an abusive childhood in 1950s New York and comes to the Massachusetts town of Flax Hill, eventually marrying local widower Arturo Whitman. Snow is Arturo\'s daughter, a girl of uncommon beauty who makes Boy obscurely uncomfortable. And Bird is the daughter Boy and Arturo have together, whose dark skin reveals the family\'s secret: Arturo, his late wife, and their families were all African-Americans passing as white. Boy, worried about what the difference between Snow and Bird will mean for her own daughter and plagued by demons of her own, sends Snow away to live with relatives. But years later, when Bird is a teenager, Snow returns...\n\nSome readers will already have identified the fairy tale of which this is a loose retelling; others will recognize it after learning that Boy, Snow, and Bird all have a strange fascination with mirrors. But the emphasis is on loose rather than retelling: those expecting a point-for-point recasting of Snow White will be disappointed. Though the novel\'s imagery frequently draws on myths and folktales, a reminder of how deeply their motifs and moral assumptions have shaped the collective imagination, its plot uses only certain elements of that specific story, as a springboard for an examination of the meaning and consequences of beauty, race, gender, and power for individual identity. A large cast of characters allows Oyeyemi to examine these issues from all sides, acknowledging their complexity and avoiding reductive answers. As one character says, If I\'m going to talk about this thing, I don\'t want to be confirming anybody\'s theories about the way life goes-- not even my own.\n\nThe first half of the novel is narrated by Boy, in whom the wicked stepmother is recast as a wry, self-sufficient woman whose ruthlessly managed expectations may be a flight from true intimacy. For her as for all three protagonists, looking in the mirror is less an act of vanity and more a search for self. Her worldview, and the sharply ironic humor that makes the novel a joy to read, is captured in her reaction to a movie: It was one of those ones they call screwball comedies, where people mislead and ill-treat each other in the most shocking and baffling ways possible, then forgive and forget about it because they happen to like the look of each other. Only they call it falling in love. Those movies are the equivalent of supernatural thrillers for me-- if I watched them too closely, I\'d shriek uncontrollably. Bird\'s voice, which takes over later on, is more direct, reflecting her youth, and a childhood more loving and less painful than what her mother endured, but she\'s no less alert to the emotional dynamics of her extended family and the consequences of its decision to pass as white.\n\nOyeyemi carefully works out all the arguments that might be made about passing: that victims of prejudice should survive any way they can, that people shouldn\'t flee their identities, that if race doesn\'t matter it shouldn\'t matter, that the gain isn\'t worth the cost. The pain wrought by notions of racial worth is never far away. But this isn\'t an issue novel. Big themes don\'t exist in neat abstractions; they matter only as they play out in actual, messy lives. This is a story about particular people and the choices they\'ve made, with the reader left to judge as and if she wishes. Boy\'s decision to send Snow away isn\'t simply about the problem (if it is a problem) of sisters with different apparent races: it\'s also a matter of Boy\'s insecurities, about herself, her past, beauty and love and the line between self-possession and self-satisfaction. A late plot development further complicates the novel\'s investigation of the line between image and reality, and leads to a climax that perfectly evokes the necessity of confronting the terrible things we do for love, and the possibility, however faint, of forgiving each other for them. Rigorously thought-through but emotionally rich, cynical yet humanist, painful and funny, this is an outstanding novel about the terrible power of images to disrupt the self.After struggling with this book then reading the glowing reviews, I am stuck with the reality that this is a book I either completely missed, or one that is not in my interest area no matter how slowly I read it, or even re-read it.\n\nThe style of author Helen Oyeyemi was a tough nut for me to crack. The side steps into fantasy, the lack of smooth transitions, and what I perceived as heavy-handedness were obstacles to my enjoyment. I found myself unable to sustain interest and labored to get through it. In short, it seemed to never really go anywhere, nor was the main character Boy fascinating enough to make me care and lock me in.\n\nAgain, Im in the minority thus far and its clear that others found plenty to cherish in this novel. I almost wish I did, too, but there are too many other books to discover for me to fret over this particular literary disconnect. I hope you enjoy it more than I did.Boy, Snow, Bird, by Helen Oyeyemi, is a dark and disturbing novel about self-identity in a complex world simmering with prejudice and misery. The authors highly stylized prose is unique, stunning, and brilliantly imaginative. The book is full of inventive, dazzling, and lyrical surprises. The tale teems with well-known, as well as quite obscure, fairy tale motifs. The author also enchants by sprinkling magical realism in odd places here and there in the mists of the plots everyday reality. The realistic and the magical worlds collide and play off against one another adding emphasis and making the realism appear just that much more grotesque. At times the book reads like a strange brew of marvelous modern macabre.\n\nBut this otherwise outstanding book failed me in a significant way. Despite the authors remarkable and obvious literary talents, I felt emotionally detached from the disturbing subject as well as from the characters. This was a novel that appealed mainly to the intellect rather than the heart. This is primarily why I hesitated and did not give this work five stars. I wanted more of an emotional connection with the characters.\n\nThere are three main characters: Boy, Snow, and Bird. Boy is a beautiful, but emotionally damaged woman, the odd survivor of a bizarre abusive childhood. After developing into a ravishing twenty-year-old platinum blond, she manages to escape her dehumanizing family situation and flees to a small town in New England. There she makes a life for herself, meets a young widower, and marries him despite the fact that she is not in love. Boy values freedom too much to allow love to enter her heart. She has never known love; how can she give it?\n\nSnow Whitman is Boys husbands six-year-old daughter. Boy is both strongly attracted and terrified by this child. Snow is arrestingly beautiful. She is the type of child everyone idolizes and desires, the type of child that has the world at her beck and call. Soon after Boy marries, she becomes pregnant and gives birth to a daughter named Bird. The new baby is black. As a consequence, Boy discovers that her husband and many of the other people she has come to know as family and friends are actually all white-skinned blacks who have long been passing for whites. What should Boy do with Bird? What should she do with Snow? She feels ensnared in an environment that worships whiteness. She fears Bird will be psychologically damaged if she is allowed to grow up in a black world dominated by an idolized white child. Can the issue of Bird in their lives force the family to abandon its long-held deceit? How will this all play out?\n\nThe book has such a large cast of secondary characters that I often found it difficult to keep track of them. If you read a digital version, you can always run a search on any name to help refresh your memory about any character and how he or she relates to the plot. However, if you read this book in print, I recommend that you take careful notes to aid your memory; youll need them. The book also contains a lot of unfamiliar black cultural references that you may need to look up on the Internet. This helped me in understanding what was going on, so I again recommend that you take the time to do this if any terms are unfamiliar to you. A lot of the new terms have to do with global ethnic fairy tale motifs.\n\nThis novel is complex. It can be difficult and confusing to read. However, as challenging as it is, it is also rewarding and well worth the effort.I\'ve loved Helen Oyeymi since reading her book The Opposite House for a book group several years ago. I had never paid much attention to her before that, but always noticed her new novels after that. I didn\'t read another, though, until Boy, Snow, Bird.\n\nThis novel is addictively readable.I could hardly put it down. There\'s such depth, using the fairy tale genre in a way that begs analysis, I wish I\'d read this title with a group. I would love to delve into it, to discuss why the main character, Boy, is actually a woman, and the fact all three main characters are female, as well. Why Oyeymi chose to turn the concept of the fairy tale inside-out, how she accomplished all she did using such sparing prose, and how she used references to other tales within the framework of this novel.\n\nHighly recommended, especially if you have the time to read it deeply, maybe even more than once. Just beautiful!"Nobody ever warned me about mirrors so for many years I was fond of them, and believed them to be trustworthy." So begins the dazzingly imaginative and enigmatically-named new novel from Helen Oyeyemi.\n\nBut what happens when mirrors are not trustworthy? When Boy is really a girl? When a beautiful pale-skinned youngster actually shares the bloodline of the black-skinned individuals? When beauty is not truth and when truth is not beauty? When a mother or a grandmother is not a safe haven but something else entirely?\n\nHelen Oyeyemi explores questions like these in her own imitable way, mixing a dose of fantasy with a dollop of reality. Her writing gifts, carefully honed in her startlingly good prior novel, Mr. Fox, are on display again here as she merges the real with the fantastical to create a canvas all her own.\n\nThe book\'s curious title is a compilation of the names of three unique women: Boy, who escapes from her abusive rat-catcher father to settle in a New England town called Flax Hill; her strikingly attractive and widely treasured stepdaughter Snow; and the daughter she conceives with Snow\'s father Arturo, named Bird. As the publicist\'s blurb on this book reveals, Bird is "colored" since Arturo and his family have long passed for white.\n\nThe observant reader can pick up the threads of the Snow White fairy tale: the "evil" stepmother (who is perhaps more protective than evil), the removal of Snow White from the scene and particularly the "Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Who\'s The Fairest of Them All" query.\n\nWho, indeed, is the fairest? Helen Oyeyemi writes, ""It\'s not whiteness that sets Them against Us, but the worship of whiteness. Same goes if you swap whiteness out for other things--fancy possessions for sure, pedigree, maybe youth too..." Or, to put another way, nothing - not race, gender, or beauty - is valuable onto itself; it is we who place the value on these attributes.\n\nMs. Oyeyemi sometimes overplays her hand. The narrative (told by Boy in the first and third sections and by her daughter Bird in the second section) loses a bit of steam when Bird takes over. The metaphors on race become too concrete as the author tackles the unfortunate devaluing of persons based on shade of pigment; the writing is far more effective when the reader draws his/her necessary conclusions on the tyranny of the mirror rather than being lead there.\n\nStill, Boy, Snow, Bird is so freshly-conceived - with lyrical writing that often leverages our mythic beliefs in fairy tales and soars into our subconscious - that it still manages to beguile. Ms. Oyeyemi is comfortable shattering many of our perceptions about race, gender, appearance, and family and does a masterful job of forcing us to confront our own mirror and ask, "Is the person reflected in the mirror a true representation about who I really am?" 4.5 stars.I was first attracted to this story basically because the title was so unique. I read the brief description and thought to myself that there may be more to this book than just a unique title, and I found that i was absolutely correct. It only starts with a unique title, and what I found was a story that flows like beautifully composed music, an exceptional reading experience.\n\nThis story is based on the fairy tale, Snow White, yet it is not a retelling in the traditional sense. It carries the essence of the Snow White tale, but it has a life all its own. It\'s magical and almost more memorable than the original tale. I believe it is because reality is blended so effortlessly within this fantasy and the fantasy aspects are so raw, edgy and even frightening at times, it can be hard to tell the one from the other, which makes this a fantastic read. The characters are so much more real to me than those in the fairy tale. They are beautifully crafted, memorable and multi-faceted. What I enjoyed most about this book is that it really made me think, and even if some of the things it brought to the surface weren\'t comfortable to consider, I can\'t say that I wasn\'t moved by it, because I was. This is a wonderful exploration into the very soul of humanity as we question what is truth and what is beauty.\n\nIt may have started with a title, but ended with a very satisfied reader. I plan on reading other Helen Oyeyemi books. Her writing is crisp and imaginative with fresh, believable dialog. I look forward to seeing more of Helen\'s writing in the future.Boy, Snow, Bird was on so many Most Anticipated Books of 2014 lists that I couldn\'t wait to get it. It did not disappoint.\n\nBoy, Snow, Bird is loosely a retelling a Snow White that explores the nuances of racial identity and cultural ideals of beauty in 20th century America. That\'s a wholly inadequate summation of this novel but it brings it to its essence.\n\nIt\'s difficult to review BSB without spoilers. If you hate spoilers, stop reading here and just go get the book. I can\'t recommend it highly enough With that said:\n\nBoy is actually a woman who escapes an abusive past and arrives in Flax Hill, MA where she eventually marries a widower, Arturo Whitman. By doing so, she becomes step mother to Snow, a child who is so beautiful that she makes Boy uncomfortable at times. Boy and Arturo have a child of their own, Bird. It is with Bird that Arturo\'s family secret is revealed. The Whitmans are a black family who pass. (Who appear to be white and allow people to think so.)\n\nBird\'s appearance (both her arrival and her physical presence) complicates things for the family. They can no longer actually pass, with the evidence of their ancestry so evident. Boy also worries about how Bird will be perceived, especially in comparison to the very beautiful Snow.\n\nOyeyemi\'s writing is both beautiful and simple. She makes literary fiction more approachable. The story is one that is really universal. This is a book about what makes a person beautiful, about honesty and about family relationships. I don\'t give too many books 5 stars but this one I would have given 6.This is an absolutely fascinating read - and one I think that would do well in a book club or book discussion group setting. I know I would love to sink into a long conversation with at least one other person about it! It is just one of those novels - like so many that have strong fairy tale overtones - that simply begs for further discussion. Inspired by the Snow White tale - Oyeyemi manages to include some larger issues than wicked stepmothers and magic mirrors. Here, readers can grapple with race issues, physical beauty, family, freedom and relationships. The book opens in New York City in the 1950s. Boy Novak, the narrator for the first and last sections of the novel, has run away from the rat catcher to Flax Hills and begins carving out her own life - finally free from her oppressive childhood.\n\nSnow, the second titular character, remains more of an enigma. Her voice only comes through her letters to her much younger half-sister, Bird. Snow becomes Boys stepdaughter (as the fairy tale would hint). Bird is the main narrator for the fascinating interior section. The plot takes some surprising turns, but the ending just feels too abrupt to be truly satisfying (hence my strong desire to talk with other readers!). I wish that Oyeyemi had gone just a bit further in the narrative. She raises so many interesting thoughts and really brings the time period to an authentically realized level. It is a strange and wonderful sort of book though - and a truly impressive blend of a sort of fairy tale quality along with elements of a more classic family drama.')

('Processing html: ', '[Because of the way BOY, SNOW, BIRD is structured, it\'s difficult to discuss the novel without giving away plot points that emerge around the halfway point. This review won\'t reveal anything that isn\'t discussed in the cover copy or implicit in the mythic structure, but readers who want to come to the novel not knowing anything should stop here, with my strong recommendation for this novel about identity and the ambiguities of race, gender, and family life.]\n\nThe title of Helen Oyeyemi\'s excellent new novel derives from the names of its three female protagonists. Boy is Boy Novak, who escapes an abusive childhood in 1950s New York and comes to the Massachusetts town of Flax Hill, eventually marrying local widower Arturo Whitman. Snow is Arturo\'s daughter, a girl of uncommon beauty who makes Boy obscurely uncomfortable. And Bird is the daughter Boy and Arturo have together, whose dark skin reveals the family\'s secret: Arturo, his late wife, and their families were all African-Americans passing as white. Boy, worried about what the difference between Snow and Bird will mean for her own daughter and plagued by demons of her own, sends Snow away to live with relatives. But years later, when Bird is a teenager, Snow returns...\n\nSome readers will already have identified the fairy tale of which this is a loose retelling; others will recognize it after learning that Boy, Snow, and Bird all have a strange fascination with mirrors. But the emphasis is on loose rather than retelling: those expecting a point-for-point recasting of Snow White will be disappointed. Though the novel\'s imagery frequently draws on myths and folktales, a reminder of how deeply their motifs and moral assumptions have shaped the collective imagination, its plot uses only certain elements of that specific story, as a springboard for an examination of the meaning and consequences of beauty, race, gender, and power for individual identity. A large cast of characters allows Oyeyemi to examine these issues from all sides, acknowledging their complexity and avoiding reductive answers. As one character says, If I\'m going to talk about this thing, I don\'t want to be confirming anybody\'s theories about the way life goes-- not even my own.\n\nThe first half of the novel is narrated by Boy, in whom the wicked stepmother is recast as a wry, self-sufficient woman whose ruthlessly managed expectations may be a flight from true intimacy. For her as for all three protagonists, looking in the mirror is less an act of vanity and more a search for self. Her worldview, and the sharply ironic humor that makes the novel a joy to read, is captured in her reaction to a movie: It was one of those ones they call screwball comedies, where people mislead and ill-treat each other in the most shocking and baffling ways possible, then forgive and forget about it because they happen to like the look of each other. Only they call it falling in love. Those movies are the equivalent of supernatural thrillers for me-- if I watched them too closely, I\'d shriek uncontrollably. Bird\'s voice, which takes over later on, is more direct, reflecting her youth, and a childhood more loving and less painful than what her mother endured, but she\'s no less alert to the emotional dynamics of her extended family and the consequences of its decision to pass as white.\n\nOyeyemi carefully works out all the arguments that might be made about passing: that victims of prejudice should survive any way they can, that people shouldn\'t flee their identities, that if race doesn\'t matter it shouldn\'t matter, that the gain isn\'t worth the cost. The pain wrought by notions of racial worth is never far away. But this isn\'t an issue novel. Big themes don\'t exist in neat abstractions; they matter only as they play out in actual, messy lives. This is a story about particular people and the choices they\'ve made, with the reader left to judge as and if she wishes. Boy\'s decision to send Snow away isn\'t simply about the problem (if it is a problem) of sisters with different apparent races: it\'s also a matter of Boy\'s insecurities, about herself, her past, beauty and love and the line between self-possession and self-satisfaction. A late plot development further complicates the novel\'s investigation of the line between image and reality, and leads to a climax that perfectly evokes the necessity of confronting the terrible things we do for love, and the possibility, however faint, of forgiving each other for them. Rigorously thought-through but emotionally rich, cynical yet humanist, painful and funny, this is an outstanding novel about the terrible power of images to disrupt the self.After struggling with this book then reading the glowing reviews, I am stuck with the reality that this is a book I either completely missed, or one that is not in my interest area no matter how slowly I read it, or even re-read it.\n\nThe style of author Helen Oyeyemi was a tough nut for me to crack. The side steps into fantasy, the lack of smooth transitions, and what I perceived as heavy-handedness were obstacles to my enjoyment. I found myself unable to sustain interest and labored to get through it. In short, it seemed to never really go anywhere, nor was the main character Boy fascinating enough to make me care and lock me in.\n\nAgain, Im in the minority thus far and its clear that others found plenty to cherish in this novel. I almost wish I did, too, but there are too many other books to discover for me to fret over this particular literary disconnect. I hope you enjoy it more than I did.Boy, Snow, Bird, by Helen Oyeyemi, is a dark and disturbing novel about self-identity in a complex world simmering with prejudice and misery. The authors highly stylized prose is unique, stunning, and brilliantly imaginative. The book is full of inventive, dazzling, and lyrical surprises. The tale teems with well-known, as well as quite obscure, fairy tale motifs. The author also enchants by sprinkling magical realism in odd places here and there in the mists of the plots everyday reality. The realistic and the magical worlds collide and play off against one another adding emphasis and making the realism appear just that much more grotesque. At times the book reads like a strange brew of marvelous modern macabre.\n\nBut this otherwise outstanding book failed me in a significant way. Despite the authors remarkable and obvious literary talents, I felt emotionally detached from the disturbing subject as well as from the characters. This was a novel that appealed mainly to the intellect rather than the heart. This is primarily why I hesitated and did not give this work five stars. I wanted more of an emotional connection with the characters.\n\nThere are three main characters: Boy, Snow, and Bird. Boy is a beautiful, but emotionally damaged woman, the odd survivor of a bizarre abusive childhood. After developing into a ravishing twenty-year-old platinum blond, she manages to escape her dehumanizing family situation and flees to a small town in New England. There she makes a life for herself, meets a young widower, and marries him despite the fact that she is not in love. Boy values freedom too much to allow love to enter her heart. She has never known love; how can she give it?\n\nSnow Whitman is Boys husbands six-year-old daughter. Boy is both strongly attracted and terrified by this child. Snow is arrestingly beautiful. She is the type of child everyone idolizes and desires, the type of child that has the world at her beck and call. Soon after Boy marries, she becomes pregnant and gives birth to a daughter named Bird. The new baby is black. As a consequence, Boy discovers that her husband and many of the other people she has come to know as family and friends are actually all white-skinned blacks who have long been passing for whites. What should Boy do with Bird? What should she do with Snow? She feels ensnared in an environment that worships whiteness. She fears Bird will be psychologically damaged if she is allowed to grow up in a black world dominated by an idolized white child. Can the issue of Bird in their lives force the family to abandon its long-held deceit? How will this all play out?\n\nThe book has such a large cast of secondary characters that I often found it difficult to keep track of them. If you read a digital version, you can always run a search on any name to help refresh your memory about any character and how he or she relates to the plot. However, if you read this book in print, I recommend that you take careful notes to aid your memory; youll need them. The book also contains a lot of unfamiliar black cultural references that you may need to look up on the Internet. This helped me in understanding what was going on, so I again recommend that you take the time to do this if any terms are unfamiliar to you. A lot of the new terms have to do with global ethnic fairy tale motifs.\n\nThis novel is complex. It can be difficult and confusing to read. However, as challenging as it is, it is also rewarding and well worth the effort.I\'ve loved Helen Oyeymi since reading her book The Opposite House for a book group several years ago. I had never paid much attention to her before that, but always noticed her new novels after that. I didn\'t read another, though, until Boy, Snow, Bird.\n\nThis novel is addictively readable.I could hardly put it down. There\'s such depth, using the fairy tale genre in a way that begs analysis, I wish I\'d read this title with a group. I would love to delve into it, to discuss why the main character, Boy, is actually a woman, and the fact all three main characters are female, as well. Why Oyeymi chose to turn the concept of the fairy tale inside-out, how she accomplished all she did using such sparing prose, and how she used references to other tales within the framework of this novel.\n\nHighly recommended, especially if you have the time to read it deeply, maybe even more than once. Just beautiful!"Nobody ever warned me about mirrors so for many years I was fond of them, and believed them to be trustworthy." So begins the dazzingly imaginative and enigmatically-named new novel from Helen Oyeyemi.\n\nBut what happens when mirrors are not trustworthy? When Boy is really a girl? When a beautiful pale-skinned youngster actually shares the bloodline of the black-skinned individuals? When beauty is not truth and when truth is not beauty? When a mother or a grandmother is not a safe haven but something else entirely?\n\nHelen Oyeyemi explores questions like these in her own imitable way, mixing a dose of fantasy with a dollop of reality. Her writing gifts, carefully honed in her startlingly good prior novel, Mr. Fox, are on display again here as she merges the real with the fantastical to create a canvas all her own.\n\nThe book\'s curious title is a compilation of the names of three unique women: Boy, who escapes from her abusive rat-catcher father to settle in a New England town called Flax Hill; her strikingly attractive and widely treasured stepdaughter Snow; and the daughter she conceives with Snow\'s father Arturo, named Bird. As the publicist\'s blurb on this book reveals, Bird is "colored" since Arturo and his family have long passed for white.\n\nThe observant reader can pick up the threads of the Snow White fairy tale: the "evil" stepmother (who is perhaps more protective than evil), the removal of Snow White from the scene and particularly the "Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Who\'s The Fairest of Them All" query.\n\nWho, indeed, is the fairest? Helen Oyeyemi writes, ""It\'s not whiteness that sets Them against Us, but the worship of whiteness. Same goes if you swap whiteness out for other things--fancy possessions for sure, pedigree, maybe youth too..." Or, to put another way, nothing - not race, gender, or beauty - is valuable onto itself; it is we who place the value on these attributes.\n\nMs. Oyeyemi sometimes overplays her hand. The narrative (told by Boy in the first and third sections and by her daughter Bird in the second section) loses a bit of steam when Bird takes over. The metaphors on race become too concrete as the author tackles the unfortunate devaluing of persons based on shade of pigment; the writing is far more effective when the reader draws his/her necessary conclusions on the tyranny of the mirror rather than being lead there.\n\nStill, Boy, Snow, Bird is so freshly-conceived - with lyrical writing that often leverages our mythic beliefs in fairy tales and soars into our subconscious - that it still manages to beguile. Ms. Oyeyemi is comfortable shattering many of our perceptions about race, gender, appearance, and family and does a masterful job of forcing us to confront our own mirror and ask, "Is the person reflected in the mirror a true representation about who I really am?" 4.5 stars.I was first attracted to this story basically because the title was so unique. I read the brief description and thought to myself that there may be more to this book than just a unique title, and I found that i was absolutely correct. It only starts with a unique title, and what I found was a story that flows like beautifully composed music, an exceptional reading experience.\n\nThis story is based on the fairy tale, Snow White, yet it is not a retelling in the traditional sense. It carries the essence of the Snow White tale, but it has a life all its own. It\'s magical and almost more memorable than the original tale. I believe it is because reality is blended so effortlessly within this fantasy and the fantasy aspects are so raw, edgy and even frightening at times, it can be hard to tell the one from the other, which makes this a fantastic read. The characters are so much more real to me than those in the fairy tale. They are beautifully crafted, memorable and multi-faceted. What I enjoyed most about this book is that it really made me think, and even if some of the things it brought to the surface weren\'t comfortable to consider, I can\'t say that I wasn\'t moved by it, because I was. This is a wonderful exploration into the very soul of humanity as we question what is truth and what is beauty.\n\nIt may have started with a title, but ended with a very satisfied reader. I plan on reading other Helen Oyeyemi books. Her writing is crisp and imaginative with fresh, believable dialog. I look forward to seeing more of Helen\'s writing in the future.Boy, Snow, Bird was on so many Most Anticipated Books of 2014 lists that I couldn\'t wait to get it. It did not disappoint.\n\nBoy, Snow, Bird is loosely a retelling a Snow White that explores the nuances of racial identity and cultural ideals of beauty in 20th century America. That\'s a wholly inadequate summation of this novel but it brings it to its essence.\n\nIt\'s difficult to review BSB without spoilers. If you hate spoilers, stop reading here and just go get the book. I can\'t recommend it highly enough With that said:\n\nBoy is actually a woman who escapes an abusive past and arrives in Flax Hill, MA where she eventually marries a widower, Arturo Whitman. By doing so, she becomes step mother to Snow, a child who is so beautiful that she makes Boy uncomfortable at times. Boy and Arturo have a child of their own, Bird. It is with Bird that Arturo\'s family secret is revealed. The Whitmans are a black family who pass. (Who appear to be white and allow people to think so.)\n\nBird\'s appearance (both her arrival and her physical presence) complicates things for the family. They can no longer actually pass, with the evidence of their ancestry so evident. Boy also worries about how Bird will be perceived, especially in comparison to the very beautiful Snow.\n\nOyeyemi\'s writing is both beautiful and simple. She makes literary fiction more approachable. The story is one that is really universal. This is a book about what makes a person beautiful, about honesty and about family relationships. I don\'t give too many books 5 stars but this one I would have given 6.This is an absolutely fascinating read - and one I think that would do well in a book club or book discussion group setting. I know I would love to sink into a long conversation with at least one other person about it! It is just one of those novels - like so many that have strong fairy tale overtones - that simply begs for further discussion. Inspired by the Snow White tale - Oyeyemi manages to include some larger issues than wicked stepmothers and magic mirrors. Here, readers can grapple with race issues, physical beauty, family, freedom and relationships. The book opens in New York City in the 1950s. Boy Novak, the narrator for the first and last sections of the novel, has run away from the rat catcher to Flax Hills and begins carving out her own life - finally free from her oppressive childhood.\n\nSnow, the second titular character, remains more of an enigma. Her voice only comes through her letters to her much younger half-sister, Bird. Snow becomes Boys stepdaughter (as the fairy tale would hint). Bird is the main narrator for the fascinating interior section. The plot takes some surprising turns, but the ending just feels too abrupt to be truly satisfying (hence my strong desire to talk with other readers!). I wish that Oyeyemi had gone just a bit further in the narrative. She raises so many interesting thoughts and really brings the time period to an authentically realized level. It is a strange and wonderful sort of book though - and a truly impressive blend of a sort of fairy tale quality along with elements of a more classic family drama.')
