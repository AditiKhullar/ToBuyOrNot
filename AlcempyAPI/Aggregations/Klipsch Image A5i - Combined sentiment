('Processing text: ', 'I have owned and still own several pairs of Klipsch IEMs; I have the S4, S4i, the X10s and, now, the A5i. I also own many other brands (Sony/JVC/Sennheiser) of earbuds and IEMs as well as bass and reference headphones, for good measure, so I\'m pretty picky about them. I have always loved the comfort, fit and sound of all my Klipsch sets and I have worked out, cycled and run with all of them. The S4/S4is, being a bit heavy, did tend to pop out now and then, while the X10s stayed put, but, at $350 MSRP, might be considered a bit pricey to abuse like that, so I was excited to try these new A5is.\n\nThe look is subjective but I like it. The ear-tips will be familiar to anyone accustomed to Klipsch IEMs; they are very comfortable. I found the hooks a little annoying since they tend to press on the outside of my inner ear, instead of against my head, which would be better; I was able to adjust them inward a bit though and they seem like they may need to relax a bit before staying there. I really wish the bottom part of the hook could be molded around the ear, instead of just pointing down; instead, there is a hook on the front of the earpiece into which you can place and wind the cord. I ran with these last night for the first time, running with them on for 14.8 miles. By the end of it, I was completely annoyed by these. The little black flex arms do let you adjust the angle, but not the pressure, so my right one KEPT popping out anyway (the left was fine). Also, these are said to be designed to be sweat-resistant but whoever designed those front cord hooks is probably not a runner, bc the process of wrapping a cord into these is worrisome enough (how much of that wrapping and pulling will the cord withstand before failing?) but add a few drops of sweat to those hooks and the cord and you have little hope of the cord staying put for longer than a few steps; it will barely go in and pops right back out if it does go in because the opening is too big, which completely defeats the purpose; take them out, and the headphone can feel loose, breaking the ear seal on every down-step, especially because the ear-tips will be wet as well and want to squeeze out. By the end of my run, I was fed up with these. I had to slow down several times to adjust these, with varying levels of success, and it was hard to find a middle ground between pushing them in too far, muting the sound, or keeping them too loose, breaking the seal and sounding airy. Even a little sweat prevented a good seal and the little flex arms that adjust the angle are not enough to keep them where they should be and really cant even address the depth/sealing problem, because the rear hook does not mold, so it cant provide adjustable pressure to hold it in place. Again, if you can get the cord to stay in the front hook, it kind of helps, until it pops out, but even then, it is NOT comfortable...it feels like you have a cord wrapped tightly around your ear lobe, because you do! Im not sure how or why they produced them like this. Klipsch: ditch the goofy hooks on the front and make the rear part of the ear hook, where the cord connects, adjustable; that is where they need a flex arm! The hooks seem to make these worse than regular earbuds, not better. Maybe others will have better luck but I think luck is precisely what you would need because the design is not well-considered for athletes.\n\nSound-wise, prospective buyers should be aware that, while these headphones cost $130, they use the same KG-15 driver as the S3...you know, the ones that cost $25-$30, so that is exactly what they sound like. That isn\'t to say that they don\'t sound good but they do not have the range, clarity or soundstage of even the S4s, with the KG-25 drivers. For $130, give me the good ones; just because I\'m sweaty doesn\'t mean I can\'t tell the difference, or I wouldn\'t be buying a premium brand in the first place! So the extra $100 is for the earhooks that aren\'t as effective as one would hope or any serious athlete must insist upon, and a remote. Klipsch has always charged too much for models with remotes, while other makers may charge $5 more, but there is simply no way on earth that these are worth $130, period. If anything, they were considerably harder to keep in than my X10s, which are lightweight, sound ***INCREDIBLE*** and, here on Amazon, cost...yep, $130, sometimes less, albeit without a remote, if you care (I don\'t use apple anything so it isnt a consideration for me but the X10i is always full $350 MSRP for some reason, while the remote-less X10, with the same MSRP, is sold at a fraction of that). I have used and bragged about Klipsch for so long that I hated to write anything negative, but once I started on these, it got easier and easier! These are not worth the price by any stretch of reason. The sound is just not bad and the fit is tricky at best. I am wearing them now because I keep hoping they are better than...well, they are...but they aren\'t. They are fine while sitting and typing, if you like paying $130 for $30 sound and green paint, but running/sweating screws them up again. They are fine for weight lifting (but I notice/feel them a lot more than my others) and stayed in while inverted but so do my other, non-sport models. Cycling produced a little whistling from the flex arms. I haven\'t tried them on my motorcycle but I doubt I would bother. I stick with $15 JVC Marshmallows for that bc the wind abuses the cords anyway.\n\nI honestly find the name A5i to be misleading. These should be called S3i Sport; giving them a higher alpha-numeric name (5) than the S4 seems to suggest higher sound quality than the S4, when it is actually inferior. These are simply green S3s with the same case as the S3, somewhat dysfunctional ear hooks and a remote; these should cost $50 max. Trust me, if you have $130 burning a hole in your pocket, you work out hard and often and want great sound and want a pair that stays put, spend that money on the X10; they are so light-weight that they don\'t pull out easily, aren\'t very microphonic and sound amazing; the cord is thin but, in seven months of daily use, I have had ZERO issues with them on runs/cycling/lifting, and the rest of the time, I have the best sounding, most comfortable IEMs to use at home, listening to FLAC on my tablet, on a flight or while shopping with mp3s. I am going to try these A5i Sports a couple more times, just because I would love to think I didn\'t get my pants pulled down on these but don\'t be sold on the bright color and the running guy on the box; these are not great for working out, especially running...buy the X10 and a pair of green shoelaces instead.\n\nEDIT: Now that I have owned these for a while, I can say that they are still annoying. They are now officially collecting dust and I have gone back to using my Image X10is for working out. EVERY time a drop of sweat hits these A5is, they become impossible to keep in place and, hence, useless. Apparently, they have not gone over well in general; they are being sold regularly on ebay for $50 and still not always selling. I guess these will be backups.These headphones are on their way back to Amazon.\n\nI am in the Phoenix area and run and mountain bike. I run up to 5 times a week and mountain bike once or twice a week, either activity anywhere from 3 to 20 miles at a time. Even if it isn\'t over 110 degrees, I sweat a lot. If I use stock Apple earbuds, they are rendered completely non-functional after 2 or 3 outings. I have been using a pair of Sennheiser CX 680i sport earbuds which I love -- but the cable broke and I only get sound out of one earbud. They actually did a good job of being sweat resistant and had pretty good sound quality. Those are my benchmark for what a good pair of sport headphones should be. My reference for spectacular audio quality is my pair of Shure SE535s.\n\nFirst, the build quality and design. The build quality of these headphones seems solid. The design is over-the-ear which makes wearing sunglasses, particularly for mountain biking, difficult. The piece that sticks out in front of your ears has a hook for cord routing. If you actually do that the remote/microphone sits right under your chin which looks ridiculous. You\'ll notice in the promo photos that this feature is not used, and I have no idea why it exists. To keep the earbuds firmly in your ear canal, there is a moldable piece. It, unfortunately, is very easy to move so every time you put in or take out your earbuds, the position changes. This means you have to find the sweet spot for good sound every time you use them. The remote/mic is backed by one big clip as opposed to a separate clip you can move (which is more common on these products). I found it difficult to anchor to my shirt without it wiggling off halfway through my workouts.\n\nSecond, the sound quality. In-ear headphones always take a bit of adjusting and experimenting to get right -- you need a good seal to get sound isolation as well as good bass. I felt like I never got these quite right in spite of ~3 weeks of continuous use. At their best, I put the sound quality on par with stock Apple earbuds which is to say the sound was okay. Not bad, not great. Disappointing for the high price tag. My Sennheiser sport earbuds were much better (and those were cheaper). For reference, I was using these with an iPod shuffle. The biggest issue was getting good, consistent bass. I tried different earbud sizes, music types, and earbud positioning -- I was never very pleased with the sound quality.\n\nThird, functionality. As I mentioned previously, the designed method of keeping the earbuds in place is a bit too flimsy. I would get the earbuds in place and head off for a run -- before I hit mile one, I would be adjusting both earbuds to get into a better position. Unfortunately, one adjustment after some activity isn\'t good enough -- I was always adjusting these earbuds. Not ideal for sport headphones (or any headphones). After I started working up a sweat, I would start to feel some sweat beads in my ear and shudder at the thought of what would always happen shortly thereafter -- sweat works its way into my ear canal and lubricates the earbud, ruining the sound isolation and earbud positioning. Eventually the sweat would work its way into the actual earbud and it would sound like I was listening to music in an aquarium. On two occasions, when it was around 105 degrees outside, one of the earbuds actually quit producing audio until it dried off. On a positive note, the remote always worked!\n\nIf you plan to use these for light workouts or gym workouts, these may suffice. Anything more and I would steer clear. These lose major functionality points for long runs or bike rides and after cessation of audio on more than one occasion, I sent them back.I have some big honking Klipsch speakers hat I bought in the 90s and I think they are still the best sound going. This made me excited to see these things available for purchase. I thought there is no way these wouldn\'t be awesome.\n\nWhen I first got them I listened and the sound, while good, didn\'t blow me away. In fact it was no better or worse than the $25 sonys I was replacing that I got from Target. I did, however, like the ear clips holding them to my ears...the sonys kept falling out when I would sweat, so still liked them.\n\nI mow a lot so this is where I use them the most. I was excited to get them on the mower. Once I did, though, I was very unhappy with their performance. Once I started sweating, they would just not stay in my ears. There was a label that stated, "For fit info go to" and gave a website. So I went there, and all they did was brag about how awesome they are with their oval design....nothing about actually fitting them in your ears. So I tried several different bud sizes with only one that felt comfortable.\n\nThese ear buds sounded good and stayed in until I began to sweat. I must have spent as much time screwing with these things as I did actually mowing. It was then I decided that I was not going to accept spending almost $100 on these things and returned them. I ended up replacing them with the JLabs. Same sound quality, but they stay in my ears, even sweaty ears!!!I\'ve been a big fan of Klipsch In-Ear Headphones for years and these are by far the best! I like to listen to music while riding my motorcycle for several reasons, one being to dampen the road noise a bit so my ears are not ringing after long trips. The noise reducing in-ear headphones which wrap around the ear are truly the ticket to preserving my hearing and allowing me to enjoy my music. I\'ve been thru several generations of Klipschs\' and these are by far the best. The cord is weatherproof and having the three button system wins the hearts of my riding buddies so that I no longer have to depend completely on hand signals when they wish to talk to me. I\'m also not stuck listening to a song I may not really want to hear since now I can skip, repeat or pause even with heavy gloves on my hands.\n\nThanks Klipsch!Ran a half marathon in these, while it rained for most of the race...these never slipped out of my ears once. I also sweat quite a bit and my previous headphones would always slip out whenever sweat got into my ears, however with these stay in no matter how much I sweat. They also sound great too. Noise isolation is very good as well, however I think too good.. probably not the smartest thing to have your music blasting near a busy intersection. Definitely pick these up if you are looking for a good pair of headphones for running, working out, etc. and has great sound quality. Had these for just over a month so no issues noted just yetMuch better than all the other Sports Headphones. Good bass-y sound and it doesn\'t drop off at all! Good buyI have been purchasing different earbuds for running for the last couple of years, trying to find something that is waterproof/sweatproof with controls and really good sound quality. I do run with the Klipsch S4i, but the more the sweat gets into the controls, it shorts out after about 2 months. I\'ve been told the sweatproof/waterproof Klipsch work but the the large control pad is really heavy and doesn\'t secure to your shirt or jacket, so it flops and flips around sometimes hitting you in the chin!! I didn\'t want that, so when I saw this model, Klipsch A5i, I thought it would be perfect!\n\nNope..its not. I really thought that there was a flexible wire in the back of ear piece so you could mold it to the shape of your ear, as everyone\'s ear shape is different. But, nope, it doesn\'t. Its just a piece of rubberized something that doesn\'t hug my ear, and as a result of that, the earbuds don\'t stay in! Something so simple to do, and they didn\'t do it! The rest of the unit is great, the clip on the control pad so you can attach it to your shirt etc and it does seem pretty sealed up too! And still the same great sound quality, great low end (bass) and nice crisp highs!\n\nBut, they will not sit on my ears, so another pair of sport buds that don\'t work! Klipsch, please put some flexible wire in the back of the ear bud so we can mold it for ourselves!! Its not rocket science!!!\n\nNow I\'m back to the drawing board for sport earbuds...I hated these headphones, there is no good way for the earbuds to stay in the ear. Also very complicated to put on. Very frustrating.Klipsch is my favorite brand of earphones, but these have proved (for me) to be better in theory than in practice. My last pair of regular earphones short-circuited from too much rough use, and so I opted for this new \'sport\' model, figuring it would be durable, and the in-line volume buttons seemed like an added convenience. Unfortunately, those buttons have proven to be a little maddening for my personal use. I use weight machines when I work out, and a few of them (arm curls, back/shoulder machines) involve pressing the chest against a pad...but whenever I do it, every time I end up pushing the volume all the way up (arrrgh!!!!) or down mid-repetitions, or else the play button is pushed and the sound goes out. I\'ve resorted to putting the cord down my shirt and pulling it up and out of the neck to get the buttons out of the way.\n\nThe sound quality is as great as ever, and the buttons are useful when biking, but for my general workout purposes--the main reason I bought this model--the unnecessary \'convenience\' has turned out to be a major inconvenience. I bought a different non-sport pair for my workouts, ironically, because of those damned buttons.The sound was mediocre and the ear-buds themselves were decent at best. They did not fall off during workouts but every time about 25-35 minutes into my workout the wrap-around ear fastener would start to press on the area behind my ear and would more times than not distract me during my workouts. I prefer to get lost in the music and workout without having to constantly having to adjust or mess with my ear-buds. The bass was pretty much nonexistent and the sound was all right but I had to turn it up to almost 3/4 of the max volume to get a decent enough sound to block out the gym background noise.I paid $50 for these and I think that is high considering the product received. The sound is okay, but not as good as apple\'s earbuds that come with the iPhone and iPod. In order to get rid of outside noise, the fit has to be just perfect and it takes a good 5-10 minutes of fiddling with them during the workout to get them just right, which is quite annoying. I bought these to avoid having to fiddle with my earbuds when running, so I\'m disappointed these require that. Having said that, once the fit is just right, no more fiddling required, which is more than I can say for apple\'s earbuds or many others. They are eventually comfortable. I just wish they had good sound, then I could recommend them. Worth about $30 in my opinion.I don\'t consider myself an audiophile so take my comments with a grain of salt; I mostly listen to rock and techno style music. Compared to other in ear buds (especially the low quality versions that usually come free with a cell phone, but also other aftermarket versions) the sound quality is good, and the bass is really good once they\'re seated properly in your ear.\n\nThe biggest downside to these is the unusual way that they fit in and around your ear. It\'s not convenient to get them seated correctly, and they often adjust themselves out of position if your sweating and moving around a lot. In order to get the deep bass they must be seated correctly in your inner ear, providing a seal. The headphones provide multiple rubber buds to fit mostly any ear size or shape; but they still move around a bit and the seal will break. Good luck pulling them out to quickly talk to someone, it will take a good 30-60 seconds per ear to get them back in properly (once you\'ve been using them a while and know how).\n\nI would imagine that there\'s a perfect ear size where these headphones work flawlessly, mine are not one of them; although I will continue using them because when they are working they sound better than anything else I\'ve tried in the lower end price range.THESE ARE GREAT HEADPHONES!!! I PURCHASED THEM FOR USE IN THE GYM WHILE WORKING OUT AND THEY WORK GREAT!! THE EAR LOOPS KEEP THEM IN REGARDLESS OF THE ACTIVITY AND THEY PRODUCE GREAT SOUND. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I got these on sale for $50! I was stoked because I have been using my cell phone ones for well over a year now. I knew this brand and knew they were going to be good headphones. However, I was wondering about the fit. In the picture it looks weird but they ft better than anything I have ever had. The clip for the volume part is great! No more bouncing around and pulling on my headphones while running!! I love these!!Well the sound was good but not great but for the money I think a four out of five is fairwhen i can get them properly in my ears, they sound fine but it is most difficult to insert them properly..These earbuds possess the sound quality of a $20 set of earbuds. This is the last Klipsch product I buy. Inferior for the money.i have average earlobes and ear canals and can cycle and run with apple earbuds easily.\ni had damaged most of my apple earbuds (wear and tear) and was looking to upgrade sound quality (bass esp.)\nand liked klipsch as a brand with my experience with their reference speakers.\nThese came apart in 2 weeks - in those two weeks i tried various ear tips and positions and found them finicky the wire too long and when you finally find the right fit it either pushes the loop over your ear or slips out over time.\ncannot recommend at all.I\'ve read some of the other reviews and honestly can\'t see why you wouldn\'t like these. Controls are very easy to manipulate and the sound is incredible. Glad I waited for these, the original prices was a bit high but with the price reduced ($70.00) I don\'t think you can beat them.I don\'t know it my ears are oddly shaped but no other headphones would stay in when I was exercising. these however do. they are fantastic. the sound is also great. I purchased a back up pair just in case. I love them. well worth the price.I didn\'t even get a day of good use out of these. They are a ridiculous pain to get in your ears and get a good seal, and one channel is already starting to cut out on me with every head movement. Poorly designed and not durable.I like sound quality of this headphone it fit as well to have do training, I just had some difficult at first use to fit it on my ears, after that it\'s nice...Sound is good, they stay in my ear. I like the easy buttons to stop or start play, volume controls. I\'d love ability to go forward or back on tunes. Next generation?OK but not great for the money. I used these before in the UK for my running training and have been happy with the build and sound quality as well as the fit (probably the most important factor for running). Ordered a new pair - this time from the USA - when the first pair broke and somehow they do not feel, fit and sound as well as the first pair. Not sure whether that is my own perception rather than fact. Other people may have different experiences of course.the great thing about these headphones is that they pack a great punch of bass and a great mixture of other tones. light weight and sweat proof!These headphones are all I expected them to be. I have owned other Klipsch in ear headphones in the past and I am a big fan. I was looking for some headphones that would not slip out of my ears when getting sweaty at the gym and these fill the bill. The only time I\'ve experienced any slipping (only the ear tips) is when I\'m lying down on the floor performing abdominal exercises. However, the over the ear design keep the actual headphones perfectly in place. Just a quick push of the ear tips places them back in place and the flex wire the ear tips are attached to help with placement way better than anything else I\'ve owned. The cord is simply THE best design for exercise...running, lifting, cardio...whatever you are doing, the cord doesn\'t get in the way. I love the fact that I can take these out of the case and just shake them out...no untwisting and fumbling with them for 2 minutes getting them unravelled. And the controls are easy to find and manipulate during exercise. I usually run the cord inside the front of my shirt and out the sleeve to my iphone and I can easily use the controls through my shirt.\n\nThe sound is all that you expect from Klipsch. Nice bass without getting too heavy. The highs are super crisp.\n\nIf you are a fitness enthusiast who needs a great pair of headphones to get you through your workouts, these are fantastic!essentially non-tangling, excellent at the gym; I like the bright color, easy to see in my bag when I travel.**UPDATE**\n\nNow that it has warmed up, I\'m not running with a tight beanie. Without something tight keeping the ear hooks in place, I have ran into issues. I\'ve tried every single tip Klipsch provided, but the earpiece doesn\'t seem to stay in my ear canal. Either the earpiece dislodges itself, or the piece that fits around my ear lifts up, so it just bounces around. I think if the wire between the hook and the earpiece were shorter, this problem would be resolved. Until this issue is updated, I\'d have to change my recommendation. As workout headphones, these are useless if they won\'t stay put.\n\n**END**\n\nI noticed there weren\'t any reviews for these headphones when I purchased, so I thought I should do my part and add my thoughts. Hopefully someone finds them useful!\n\nAfter using these for a 30 minute run last night, during my commute into work, and sitting at my desk for 1/2 the day, I\'d like to offer my first impressions. Hopefully I can update at a later date to address the water-resistance and quality over time.\n\nComfort\nI\'ve been through many "sport" or "water-resistant" headphones (Jaybird Freedom, Motorola S10-HD, Philips Actionfit Overhook, Sennheiser PMX680) since I tend to sweat when I workout. All of them would eventually start to become uncomfortable in the ear canal when worn for more than an hour. During the 4+ hours I\'ve worn the A5i headphones today, I have yet to experience any issues with fit or comfort.\n\nBuild Quality and Design\nAccording to Klipsch, the cable on the A5i is lined with kevlar to make it stronger. While I cannot confirm those claims, I can tell you it does feel much more substancial than the cable on my Reference S4i headphones. Due to the over-the-ear design, and improved jack casing, I am confident I won\'t have the wire shortage issues I had with the S4i (at the jack) and the Reference S4i (at the earpiece). Speaking of the cable...I couldn\'t find the length listed anywhere on line or on the box itself. I don\'t have the measurement, but felt it was too long to comfortably use with an armband (there was cable flying around everywhere), though it was shorter than average earbud cables.\n\nI also really like the way the earbuds fit into your ear. Since the bud is only loosely connected to the over-the-ear portion, I am able to adjust the over-the-ear portion and the earbud independently of each other.\n\nSound\nI\'m not a high level audiophile (so your opinion on sound may differ than mine), but in terms of workout headphones I found the sound to be great. Though the headphones came with a sticker attached stating "Proper ear tip size = perfect seal + deep bass", I found the bass to still be a little weak (though I personally prefer low bass while running). If you\'ve had any other Klipsch earbuds, the crisp, clean sound will be familiar.\n\nIn regard to mic quality, I made a call while on my way home from running. The person on the other end was able to hear me okay. It wasn\'t as clear as my Reference S4i mic, but A LOT better than any of my other sport headphones I\'ve owned. Siri had a hard time understanding me through the headphone mic...as always.\n\nBecause the earbuds are designed to seal around your ear canal, there is the stethoscope effect. Though I found this to be less of an issue than on the other headphones on my list. I was further able to minimize the effect by clipping the remote to my shirt (though it kept coming unclipped during my run).\n\nValue\nI have really been enjoying these headphones, but $130 is a high price to pay for them. That said, one of the things I love about Klipsch is their two-year warranty. As I mentioned above, I had issues with my S4i\'s and my Reference S4i\'s beginning to short. One quick, easy email exchange with Klipsch and a replacement pair were on their way. At least I can be confident that Klipsch will stand behind these for the next two years of ownership.These are the best headphones I\'ve ever used for working out. They stay securely in your ears and are really comfortable. They are well made and cool looking. The bass response isn\'t booming but it rarely is with small ear-bud style headphones like these.\nI would highly recommend them to anyone for running, biking or wearing to the gym.Very good headphones for riding bicycles. Difficult to fit to my ears initially but work really well. Sound quality is very good.So after reading all the previous reviews I decided I would give these a shot. I still haven\'t exercised with them yet, but as of now, they are actually really good :).\n\nPros:\n\nEven on the loudest volume, others around you can\'t hear the music\nSound Isolating (only works when you are about 3/4 of the way up on the volume on an iPhone)\nStays in your ear\nTangle Free\nControls work on a MacBook too\nActual ear inserts (not the different sized buds) can be moved around to fit the contours of your ear\nMany different sized buds for your perfect fit\nThe cable really does feel stronger\n\nCons\n\nThey do begin to hurt your ears if you keep them in for too long, but you don\'t have to put them all the way in because there is a clip on the ring for you to loop the wire around. Although this looks and feels strange you wouldn\'t even need to put the bud in your ear, but with the clip, if you line it up correctly, you can have it lay on your canal instead of in it.\nThe remote is awkwardly placed because when you clip it on your collar there is too much wire left over.\nThe double and triple click actions take some time to get used to the speed or time between each click for it to work. Sometimes when you try to skip it just pauses and unpauses itself.\nYou should clean your ears often because when you take the buds out sometimes wax clings on and it gets kind of disgusting\nThe case they come with is nice but very small and it can get a bit difficult to effectively put the buds in\nIf the buds aren\'t around your neck or in your ear and you put them in your pocket or in the case, the wires don\'t really tangle and knot with each other, they tangle into the earbud\n\nAll in all though, these are a very good buy. I haven\'t really gotten in ear headphones because I thought they would get uncomfortable and hurt my ears, but if you get a good brand with many buds, then you can make a size for yourself and it won\'t hurt your ears at all. I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD558 and Dr. Dre Studio Beats. Obviously compared to those, these are like a dinky toy but they still work great. It doesn\'t have a great bass but it is very clear and still a great purchase.It is indeed a very good phone, but is overpriced.\nPros are that it does not make that noise on ear when cord touch the body when runnig.\nIt is alitle tricky to put on ear.I\'m totally upset, the headphones came broken from the manufacturer, the buttons to increase/decrease the volumen was not working. Indeed, I just hear the music, but isn\'t posible to use the buttons. So, I paid a lot of money for nothing.')
