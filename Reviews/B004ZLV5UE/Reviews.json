            "text": "I picked up the Verizon iPhone 4 on its release date and am very pleased with its performance so far. Previously, I used a Droid Incredible, which was also a great phone.\n\nTo preface this review, I am a light to moderate user that mostly uses the device for making phone calls, texting, checking email, and occasionally using internet and maps. I'm not the type to sit around for hours playing games on my phone, nor have I ever streamed any video on my phone. I have one \"official\" app on my iPhone that is related to the camera, and I don't use it to listen to music; I have a separate iPod for that (to save my phone's battery).\n\nThe Verizon iPhone works great as a phone and has the best call quality in a smartphone that I have ever used. This is in comparison to my previous Droid Incredible, a Blackberry Curve prior to that, and my friend's Motorola Droid. The earpiece volume is crisp and sufficiently loud, making the other person easy to hear. The microphone works well too based on what people I call tell me. The visual voicemail system is phenomenal- it's all managed by the phone itself instead of through Verizon, so when a person gets your voicemail message, all they hear is your personalized recording without the \"at the tone, please record your message. When you are finished recording...\" garbage.\n\nTexting and email work nicely. The touch keyboard feels more natural than most other touch screens I've used on other mobile operating systems. One strange thing about texts is that the phone will make a \"whoooop\" noise everytime you send a text. There's no way to turn this sound off by itself without putting the entire phone in silent mode. Not a big deal for me, but I can see how this would really annoy some people.\n\nBased on my personal experience and all the reviews floating around online, the camera is without question the highest quality camera you will find on any phone today because of an ideal blend of lens quality, the type of sensor, and a modest megapixel count. Higher megapixels do not correlate with higher quality images; although there are many other phones out there in the 8+ megapixel range, none match the overall image quality of the iPhone. The 8 MP camera on my Droid Incredible doesn't even come close.\n\nOne thing I really miss from the Android OS is Google Navigation. No turn-by-turn voice guided navigation software comes with the iPhone. Apps are available that provide this feature, but they are inferior to Google's program.\n\nBattery life is excellent for this type of phone. Most days with light to moderate use from 7 AM to midnight, I end the day with around 80% battery remaining. Obviously, if you're a power user, it's gonna use more juice. I'm particularly impressed with how little battery is used when the phone is on standby. Battery life was my biggest gripe about Android (HTC phones tend to be notoriously bad at battery conservation), and it is a huge relief to not have to carry around a spare battery anymore.\n\nIf you're considering converting to Apple from an Android phone, there are a few areas of frustration. The notification system on the iPhone is archaic and unnecessarily intrusive. Texts will pop up on the screen regardless of whatever you're doing, requiring you to exit whatever you're in the middle of to reply. Android's notification system is excellent, and I am hoping this issue will be addressed in a later version of iOS. Also, there is very little flexibility as far as how the phone is personalized to your tastes. Not happy with the 6 text tones that Apple gives you? Too bad- you're stuck. There's no easy way to add more text tones. A third issue- when using Safari mobile, there is no way to disable mobile view. Sites like yahoo and banking sites will automatically funnel you to the mobile (crippled) version of their websites. In Android, all you do is check a box to disable mobile view. No such luck with iOS.\n\nFortunately, there is a way around all of the above restrictions, provided you're a moderately intelligent person with a basic knowledge of computers. This and any iPhone can be easily modified to fix all the problems I mentioned- just search online for instructions.\n\nThe back glass plate seems to be fairly prone to collecting light scratches. I had my last phone for 10 months with no case and no screen protector the entire time, and it never got a single scratch. Since noticing the tiny scratches on the back of my iPhone, I bought a minimalistic case for it, and it's been fine since then. Still no scratches on the front glass in 5 weeks of use so far, so I have no plans to ever use a screen protector.\n\nOne last thing I'll mention: there is not a single piece of Verizon bloatware on this phone, unlike every other smartphone I've owned that came installed with all the crap applications loaded on by the carrier that you can't remove.\n\nThere are lots of good phones out there right now. In my opinion, this one is the most polished, and despite some limitations, it provides the most satisfying overall user experience that is yet to be matched. Highly recommended.",

When I took it to a place that fixes iPhones they confirmed that the back of the phone was not original, the phone had been opened before, it had bent tabs and the wrong screws! I paid to have the lens repaired. He offered to reimburse me and never heard from him again. Don't buy from him. He is selling refurbished phones as brand new phones. I don't know why Amazon allows him to sell on their web sight. He must joy out of ripping people off. One day it will all come full circle.",

            "text": "As the title states, this was my first iPhone. After seeing my girlfriend get an iPhone 3 I became infatuated. I ended up getting one when my contract was up about a year after drooling over it. It was a great phone (I recently upgraded to the iPhone 5) and I would purchase it again if it weren't for the iPhone 5. The amount of features it unlocked after coming from a non-smart phone is incredible. The abundance of apps is great and the quality of the phone overall is superb.\n\nThe battery life blew all my other phones out of the water. The picture is crystal clear and the sound that comes out of the phone isn't bad. It's better than my other phones (Samsung Glyde, Samsung Reality) but it's certainly not great. Call reception is great on Verizon, I've never had a dropped call and I get service where a lot of other cell users do not.\n\nMy only qualms is that it doesn't support 4G and not all apps on the app store free or that great, but this is not the fault of the phone.\n\nNow that the iPhone 5 is out the iPhone 4 seems more reasonably priced and remains almost as great as the 5. The iPhone 5 is WAY overpriced and doesn't do much more than the 4. So overall, the 4 is a great phone and I would recommend it to anybody.",

            "text": "The Apple iPhone 4 is one of Verizon's best all around smartphones. While it no longer sets the pace in the smartphone realm, the iPhone 4 does an adequate job of handling nearly all basic smartphone tasks and offers well rounded performance; which is all that many smartphone users really want from their device. While it is not for everyone, and no device is, the iPhone 4 is a solid device and is definitely worth a look for non-power smartphone users.\n\n1. Design.\n1. The compact and svelte design of the iPhone 4 is refreshing, as the smartphone ecosystem continues to evolve from \"brick\" to \"cinder block\" sized phones. It is slim and pocketable, and the side keys are arranged in an intuitive manner. Volume keys and the power button (which doubles as a screen lock) are very tactile, and the ring/vibrate toggle on the top left side of the phone is a great addition. While the phone's physical appearance is subject to personal taste, i'd wager few would find the phone unattractive. I have the white version of the phone, and find it much more vibrant and visibly appealing than the more unassuming black version, though some may find the white to be too loud on the eyes.\n2. Despite the phone's relatively small size compared to other smartphones, there's a bit too much wasted space on the front of the phone for my liking. While the screen is clear and bright (there is no pixelation whatsoever due to the 960x640 resolution), it's a tad small when considering the width and length of the device. In fairness, problems due to the screen's size are more a product of the operating system and not the physical dimensions of the screen, but the OS also has no relation to empty space on the phone's front face.\n3. Both the front and rear facing camera's are flush with the phone's design, which is a big plus. Apple also hit the correct layout for the charging/data port and the 3.5 mm headset jack; the former is located on the bottom of the phone, while the latter is at the top. Several phones i've used (feature and smart, and from almost every manufacturer) had the headset port on the bottom, which is fine if you like to hold your phone upside down all the time, and also featured charging ports in the middle of the left or right side of the phone. If Apple changes anything about the physical design of the next iPhone, these two items should not up for discussion.\n4. One thing that should be up for discussion however, is the back of the phone: it is made out of glass. Many iPhone 4 users lament this, but Steve Jobs didn't amass a fortune by mistake. The more people that drop the phone and break the glass on the back, the more money Apple makes. It's a design flaw, even if it was intentional.\n\nPerformance\n1. Calls: I tested the iPhone 4 on Verizon's network in a variety of locations across Louisiana. Call quality has been very good; I have not encountered any dropouts or conversational blips during any call. Callers do not sound overly warm through the earpiece, but they do not sound robotic either. Callers also sounded good through the included headset and on three different bluetooth headsets I tried, but speakerphone quality was abysmal at best. The speakerphone is not loud enough and suffers from \"the wax paper effect.\"\n2. Reception: the iPhone 4 gets above average reception on Verizon's network; like many Verizon phones, I generally have 3-4 bars nearly everywhere I travel. It rarely has full signal but I haven't dropped below two bars either.\n3. Battery Life: the battery will take you through a day of heavy usage and two days of light usage. Phone calls use surprisingly little power, and I only lose 2-3% of juice while the phone is on standby during the night.\n4. Data Speeds: While this varies from location to location, I find that the iPhone 4 isn't as quick in this regard as other phone's i've used, particularly Blackberry and Android devices. Depending on the location, I generally get about 10-20% slower speeds on average with the iPhone 4. In fairness, I've observed the same with my fiancee's iPhone 4 on At, so it's not a carrier issue. Regardless, I haven't had any problems loading large webpages, streaming audio and video, and moving files. In the two areas I spend the most of my time in, my download speeds range from 0.6 to 1.4 MB, and my upload from 0.5 to 0.8 MB, which is normal for many Verizon phones in many locations. With that being said, it is clear that Verizon's 3G network is slowly clogging up, which i'm hoping the influx of 4G upgrades and devices will address. Despite these notations, Verizon's 3G network is far more consistent in terms of speed and connection than other carriers in the area. My fiancee's iPhone 4 on At ranges anywhere from 150 KB to 3 MB down and 50 KB to 1 MB up, and even though At theoretically has a faster 3G network than Verizon, my data connection seems far more reliable.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Operating System: After using several smartphones with different operating systems, i've concluded they are all more or less the same with a few differences here and there: tap an icon on the screen and go. Up front, I don't find the iPhone 4's OS any easier or harder to use than Android, RIM, WebOS, and Windows Phone 7, and I also don't buy into the idea that iOS is simpler and easier to use than those offered by its competitors. There are a few differences here and there; Android offers widgets, Blackberry offers a few home screen icons and a drop down menu, and Apple offers...a convoluted mess of icons and programs with little rhyme or reason. It's simple to use, but that does not mean it is always pleasant. A drop down menu would do wonders for this OS. Personally, I miss the widgets than Android and Windows Mobile offer, but I understand Apple cannot become too much like its competitors (well, maybe not until OS 5). However, there is little organization going on when you first fire up the screen.\n\nWhere iOS really begins to look like every other OS is when you delve deeper into the menu. Again, there is little rhyme or reason to how anything is arranged, and for a couple of weeks until you memorize where every option is located, it can be a frustrating experience. My favorite example was browser settings; you cannot access them from the browser, but only from the overall settings menu itself. Is this any better or worse than other OS? No. Is it any easier though? Well, no again.\n\nA final side note: iOS does not require \"babysitting\" and constant attention like Android does in order to get your battery through the day. I know rooting solves many of Android's babysitting issues, but a lot of people have jobs, families, and other hobbies that make rooting an unnecessary annoyance. While I personally like Android OS better for the customization it offers, the entire babysitting/rooting issue is a turn off to some, and I myself don't miss them either (even though I never had a problem rooting an Android device).\n\n2. Business functions: Apple does not have the business reputation of RIM or even Android yet, but nothing from my usage suggests it is inferior to either OS in this regard. Push e-mail works like a charm, Exchange works as it should, and Office files along with PDF's open and render as they should. I am not a power business user and cannot offer comment on such, but the iPhone 4 gets the basics down in this category.\n\n3. Multimedia: This is a big of a mixed bag for me. The iPhone's 4 camera is one of the best i've ever used on a smartphone; both the rear and front facing. Though the rear camera is only 5MP, images are clear, sharp, and beautiful as long as there is adequate light. Night shots with flash were less than stellar, which should surprise no one with a smartphone. The front facing camera is only 1.3 MP, but still takes images with little distortion. Beyond this, i'm not blown away with the iPhone 4's multimedia capabilities. iTunes integrates files nicely with the phone, but i'm not sold that Apple's ecosystem is any better than dragging and dropping. The iPod is perhaps the most underwhelming feature on the phone; I find it no different or more impressive than any other smartphone music player on any other device. And the speakerphone performed no more impressively for music and video playback than it did for voice calls; multimedia audio sounded waxed over and washed out on the speaker. The AppStore will only impress those migrating from RIM, WM7, and WebOS. But one thing I've noticed about using applications on the iPhone 4 is that they don't seem to crash nearly as often as they do on Android and Blackberry, and in fact, I don't think i've had even a handful of them in a month's usage. And the lack of Flash does not seem to be a hindrance on the phone's multimedia capabilities; QuickTime handles things well, and the YouTube app helps too. Again, multimedia is a mixed bag on the iPhone 4, but that's more a knock on the hype the device receives rather than the device itself.\n\nConclusion:\nOther than subtle differences in the OS, the iPhone 4 offers the same similar features that many other smartphones offer. It does a good job of handling core functions and basic business needs, and its multimedia package is somewhat overblown, yet still more than adequate. If your looking for a mid sized smartphone that requires little maintenance and don't need LTE services, the iPhone 4 is definitely worth a look. For the price however, it offers few features that stand apart from any of the other top smartphones in Verizon's lineup.",

            "text": "I own an Android device and top-notch PC but unfortunately have to try and operate and troubleshoot iPhones and iPods for family members. Android devices are very user friendly but iPhones - they're just unfriendly. It seems that they are constantly sending you to the iTunes or app store to buy more more and more. I recently tried to copy purchases from one iPod3 to an iPod4 and found their website full of incomplete instructions on how to do this. So I went into one of the trendy Apple Stores in the mall and learned that their stores are not infact full of customers - but Apple product owners in for technical support on their malfunctioning or misbehaving products! The youngster who help me was impatient - definitely not as helpful as the Verizon Experience store folks helping me with my Android. And while it might seem I'm reviewing Apple in general and not the phone, please bear in mind that if you buy an iPhone you too will have to deal with the unhelpful iTunes website, Apple's useless technical support and their tendency to sell you more products rather than access and enjoy what you've already bought from them. Not to mention I just bought a camcorder and found several reviewers disappointed that their Apple computers won't recognise the best image output from their camcorders - this is because Apple wants you to buy Apple Video Editing programs. So remember, once you start going down the Apple road, things become unfriendly with Apple blocking access to many features of your non-Apple tech products (I don't know any other tech line that does this). As for the iPhone4 - I honestly recommend you compare it with the best Android device and see which will allow you to move 'your' purchases amongst your devices most easily.",

I had to get a new phone when my old one crapped out, so I thought, \"Why not get the most hyped up phone on the market?\" Now I know WHY it's so hyped up...it's definitely the coolest phone I've seen! When I received it, it had only been used for 6 hours. It was in pristine condition and had a clean ESN. The only bad thing I have to say about the iPhone is that if you're using it frequently during the day, it'll only last about 24 hours, so I have to charge it every night. But that's not really a problem for me because I've always done that. I just plug it in right before I go to bed. Apps are easy to download, ringtones are clearer and crisper than on any other phone I've had, and it's true what they say: If you have a need for it, there's an app for that! Apps are also very easy to erase if you don't like them. It's also very nice that I can turn my phone sideways when sending a text and the keypad gets a little bigger (I have big fingers), so I don't mess up my typing as much. It didn't come with an instruction manual per se, just a little pamphlet thing that told me about a few things that it does. It was fun to figure the phone out as I used it. I haven't had ANY problems with it (I've had it for a little over two months) and I'm so glad I purchased this phone! Easily the best $475 I've ever spent!",

I have found myself using my phone to not only maintain personal work-orders while at work, but also keeping inventory and track of how much of products I have on hand at multiple buildings and being able to scan items in inventory, and scan them out of inventory by using the camera....\n\nIt takes High Def video and photos so I definitely cannot complain about that. And because everything in it is solid state, nearly everything you do is instantaneous. Simplicity is the way of Apple, and if you can't figure something out it's usually because it's simpler than what you thought it would be.\n\nOne must if you buy this phone is to get a case from a company called Lifeproof [...], these cases will make your iPhone water-proof, dirt-proof, snow-proof, and shock-proof... and I mean you can literally take your phone into the water WITH YOU.... a definite must, and nearly unbeatable ruggedness compared to cases offered for other phones.\n\nPeople say Apple is over-rated, but I switched from PC to Mac back in 2006 and I will NEVER go back to a Windows based product (This is from a PC Technician)",

Since the problem got worse over time and I didn't report it promptly, I had very low expectations for a satisfactory resolution.

I never dropped a call on my end so far. I'm on 3G now thogh I don't know why they don't update mine to 4G.\n\n The 16 GB HDD is pretty spacious. I'm able to hold 150 songs and around 120 apps and I still have lots of room to maneuver. The memory and CPU helps it run very well. Most apps never crash on me compared to android apps like google which now crashes all the time on android market in my experience. The battery is pretty good if you take care of it. Charge it when it's at 20% and don't try to charge it overnight and use a 5 volt charger as much as you can. If you take care of the battery it can last almost two days without charging it.\n\n The 3G network does have problems sometimes because it occasionally switches from 3G to 1X which is a pain in the ASS sometimes like when I try to use the GPS or brouse the web. It even switches from 3G to 1X even with international CDMA turned off. the newest IOS 7 doesn't look as good as IOS 6. IOS 6 looked more professional. In IOS 7 the apps are more cartoony which I don't really like but whatever. Another thing I don't like is how the slide down menue is on the bottom of the lock screen which is annoying because I end up activating the slide down menue instead of unlocking the phone.\n\n Over all I still love it. I don't think I'm upgrading for a while because it's still good to me Apple in my opinion rushed the 5, 5c and 5S. The iPhone 4S to me still feels like a top of the line. I forgot to mention the 8 megapixel camera! It's great to. Pictures come out beautifully if you allow it time to adjust to light and focus and photos don't take up allot of HDD space. Also there is a small flaw in the speaker when watching YouTube videos. The YouTube audio seems to play through the ear piece next to whe webcam instead of the bottom speakers like its supposed to and I've tried everything I can to try to fix it so I might need to take it to apple or version store to find out why it does that.",

I searched high phones and researched the low phones; phones of all makes and models. My adult daughter has had her iPhone4 for over a yr. and has just raves about it. I of course had to explore this rave area as well. With a few inklings swirling in my head and not wanting to extend my contract with Verizon I delved into Amazon to see what I could find. Alas, I happened upon this phone! Phone attributes Simple to use. Fast data speeds. More success with placing calls in problem areas. Calls connect faster. Fast internet connection using either Wi-Fi or Hotspot. Palm friendly size. Only two color choices. But dont most people use a cover or case these days? Use as an iPod for music and HD videos, sounds are crisp and clear with great retina display. Average picture ability, front, and back cameras with 5X zoom. Long life battery for average talk and data uses. Well ya'll can look up the specs but this is the precise phone I needed for my uses at the best price. Being a used phone and purchasing it over the internet, I was very leery. BUT I received it fast, well packaged, in great condition (better than anticipated), as offered from an honest seller.",

            "text": "Choosing a smart phone seems like it should be an easy decision, right? But in fact it is not. We have such a difficult time choosing what smart phone is right for us because there are so many styles and models to choose from. The two latest and most popular operating systems on the market are the Android designed by Google and iPhone is designed by Apple. For the past few years I was known to change my phone every 3 - 4 months. I was encouraged to switch to the iPhone due to the problems I was experiencing with the Android phones. Even though Android phones have bigger screen sizes iPhones have better quality, battery life and game selection.\nScreen Size:Android has a variety of screen sizes to choose from. Depending on manufacture, it ranges from 3.2\" to 4.3\". A larger screen comes in handy for surfing the web, viewing text heavy pages, and seeing a lot more detail in pictures and videos. iPhones have a much smaller screen than the Android phones and it makes it difficult to surf the web and scroll on screen.\niPhones offers a simplicity and better quality than Android phones. I am able to pick up an iPhone and quickly understand what's going on. It has one main button on the front of the device and everything consists of tapping app icons from the home screen. However, Android has several buttons that perform a variety of functions. It has many possible home screens and ways of doing things from those screens that can get you confused easily. Android models are low quality and are made from plastic. One of the biggest problems I had with Android phones was that it would always freeze and I would always have to restart the phone.\nApple phones have a longer lasting battery that will get you through your day without having to worry that it will die on you. With an iPhone you can manage what is running in the background with a push of a button. You decide whether to keep the apps open or closed them by holding down the home button. An iPhone can give you up to 8 hours of battery life, even when you watch videos, play games or even surf the internet. Due to Android's larger screens, their battery burns faster so you're going to have to carry your charger with you at all time to be able to charge it when it dies. The Android phone gives the user at least 4 hours of battery life.\n\nGames:An iPhone has a better game selection. Apple is a major player in the mobile video game market and it has a wide selection of free games to choose from. Android doesn't keep up with the updates of the free games. Android has good games but you have to pay for them. Some of the game companies have stopped making games for it all together.\nIn conclusion each phone has its pros and cons; it just comes down to what you prefer in a phone. Switching over to an iPhone has been the best decision I've made when choosing a phone. Why choose an iPhone? iPhone gives the user what they need, better battery life, quality and game selection.",

Although I said no to downloading OS7, it downloaded when I finally gave in to the keyboard fix and really, really makes the Iphone very hard to read because it has a transparent look to help you with other applications. When you go online, you now have WHITE LETTERS against a WHITE BACK GROUND or white letters against a light green back ground which you cannot fix on your phones screen! You now have to darken the back ground (I use BLACK NOW!), just to be able to see your ICONS and applications better! The download also changes your address book and not all address/contacts will sync between my MacBookPro and my IPhone 4s? Yes, I called tech support but they do not have an answer as to why apple did this new look. I called tech support twice before I did the KeyBoard Fix and was advised TWICE by tech support (documented at apple support) as the fix required 3.1 GB! When I asked apple why the file was so big, I was advised not to worry as the fix would leave everything on my phone the same as it was but the down load needed that space to down load the 4s keyboard fix. What really happens is you end up with the look of the cheaper IPhone C. Apple ruined the 4s with this recent upgrade to OS7 operating system which went from easy to see, easy to read, easy to sync, to almost impossible unless you keep adjusting the brightness for each article you want to read-what a pain!. I AM DONE WITH APPLE PRODUCTS UNLESS THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR MISTAKE WITH A FIX, TO MAKE MY 4S LOOK AND WORK THE WAY I PURCHASED IT! It is now almost impossible to go on line and read anything as the screen gives out a powerful white back light that makes you just give up on using your apple IPhone to do any type of research which means staring at the screen which really makes you physically ill (check reports of such on line). This is the first negative report I have ever given to APPLE. Their tech support is the best! But, even tech support can not fix a basic, powerful, APPLE, misstep. Why apple decided to make the OS7 change the screen on the Iphone 3, 3s, 4, 4s very hard to see with the human eye, is totally beyond my comprehension! Who wants a phone with great apps if you CAN'T READ THE DARN SCREEN! There should be a warning that states this keyboard patch will COMPLETELY INSTALL A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM. IF YOU DO NOT USE OS7, THEN OS7 SHOULD WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE INSTALLING A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM THAT WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE HOW YOUR PHONE LOOKS AND OPERATES. APPLE JUST WANTS TO FORCE YOU INTO OS7.",

In this regard I was correct. My model shipped with IOS 4.0 installed and that was very fun. The feature that makes this phone great compared to the competition is the Operating System. IOS is the best system available for a smart phone. I've owned 3 Android Phones and 3 iPhones. The iPhone is definitely the best of the bunch and I don't expect that I will be going back to a Droid anytime soon. The build quality of the iPhone 4 is superb. The glass resists scratches and the iPhone 4 has glass on both the back and front (compared to previous iPhone models and the iPod Touch). This leaves it very resistant to scratches. All of my Android Phones scratched easily.\n\nThe iPhone 4 is weak in a few areas. The volume isn't as loud as it was on my Android phones (especially the Droid Incredible). I would rate the actual sound quality as high and the volume as average. The Wireless is hit-and-miss at best. Apple used the same Broadcom wireless module that is found in the iPad and iPod Touch. This module is a very low-power device which translates into low range. It's not uncommon for the iPhone to struggle with picking up Networks that other devices can see easily. The iPhone 4 lacks a SD Card Slot and thus cannot be upgraded. The Battery is also built-in and will have to be replaced by Apple if it fails. The iPhone relies on iTunes for syncing media which can be a pain if you're not a big iTunes user. The Camera takes amazing pictures... as long as the subject isn't moving. There is a noticeable delay in taking motion pictures. The Video Quality however is fantastic.\n\nOverall the Verizon iPhone 4 is a great addition to the Apple Library and deserves 4 stars. It does have a few downsides, but the enjoyment that you will get out of it will make you forget them. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone that enjoys Apple Devices.",

Between calls, emails, texts, and my daughter playing on it, the battery can go fast. The easiest solution I can offer is to keep a charger in the car/ on hand. My favorite feature is the camera. The pictures it takes are pretty good quality, and after you print them they turn out quite nice. This is good especially if you don't always have your digital camera handy.

Further inspection of the box I see a little white sticker over the 8gb printing on the back of the box, which someone covered up really well, not noticeable at a quick glance. Ridiculous....I'm very disappointed with Amazon on this one. I'd return it, but I can not be without a phone for 4-7 days as I need it for my electrical contracting business. All in all, the phone works exactly as it should, but I am irritated because I spend a good amount of money on Amazon and got screwed on a phone.

The only concern we had with it physically was that the power button was a little sticky. It doesn't make the click noise like most do when you press it. No visible scratches, even though we expected to find a few. Everything else seems to work perfectly. It also arrived in original packaging, and was packed well to avoid accidents during delivery.\n\nAs for the phone itself, it's what you would expect from an iPhone. The difference in processing power is definitely noticeable when we compare it directly to the 4S. The new operating system installed well, and games and apps work fine. But there is definitely a noticeable lag.\n\nOverall, we are happy with the choice we made.",

It is still slower than I had anticipated (perhaps there really is a difference between the 4 and the 4s that I had before) but at least it functions. The first iPhone that I received had a completely dysfunctional battery. After returning it to the company (to the incorrect address that I was given), I received the same phone with a new battery weeks later. It was still unusable, though it ceased the sporadic battery loss after the first day of use. The phone refused to stay connected to Wi-fi for more than 45 seconds, which became almost comical. Almost. After complaining extensively to Brad's voicemail and via email (I don't think we ever spoke on the phone except the first time I called) I was sent a new-used-iPhone, seriously nicked, which functions well enough. If you are planning on buying this online to save money, I would reconsider. This took me almost 4 months longer than it would have if I had just sucked it up. Or at least bought a phone from someone in CA rather than freaking Tennessee, and what a terrible experience it was.",

I checked the new and used prices and found one called \"Hollywood Merchandise\" and something else, the cost was only $175 plus tax which came out to $179. It actually came very fast. Shipped in two days, considering I live in California though. But where I live is completely on the other side of California.\n\nDown to the condition though.\nThe condition of this phone is pretty good. It came packaged into USPS, the mailman left a key in my mailbox which opens the big boxlike part of the mailbox, bubble wrapped packaging in an orange envelope for papers, the iPhone was in a box that says \"iPhone\" on the front of it with a picture of the iPhone 4, nothing more. Came with a charger cable and a USB wall adapter, a pair of microphone earbuds (pretty cheap, but still.), and the iPhone had a screen protector on it to protect any scratches while being shipped and it also lied down on its face with some black plastic thing to protect the back of the iPhone. The phone was also inactivated ! I was worried I was going to order an activated iPhone that was someone else's. But the only things that were wrong with the phone is that you can tell someone left an otterbox defender case on it for roughly over 6 months at least. It is a tad bit scratched but I actually just rubbed rubbing alcohol on it and it cleared up fairly well. I mean the scratches are still there but it's not something you notice the first time when holding the phone. The last thing is that the vibration on the phone makes a disturbing sound, as if the phone were laying on a wooden desk and it was on silent and it makes a chattering noise from the wood, but I don't use vibration cause I never have my phone on silent, so it wasn't a problem at all for me actually.\n\nI am a very satisfied customer and I recommend this to anyone, even if the iPhone 5 is out. I feel late but this will do for sure until I get to working this summer.",

They bought it with the contract with Verizon.\n\nUnfortunately what I needed is a new cell phone, not a multipurpose small computer. I carry my cell phone when driving or working outside for safety to call for help in event of an accident. It uses Sprint service and there is good service within 50 miles radius of my home.\n\nSince I am on the edge of Verizon service in my area, this connection is weak.To use the dial features, I have to put on my reading glasses and make multiple swipes to make the IPhone call anybody. Siri does not work at all without excellent connection service so a major feature that might have worked is not available to me.\n\nBecause of the poor reception area, the IPhone keeps searching all the time for a good signal. This decreases the battery life to about 4 hours.\n\nIt would be a great phone for someone in a city, who does not use reading glasses, accesses internet for sports scores and plays on-line games. It is of no value to me at all.",

After further review on the 3 previous phones, here's my pros & cons about the iphones I've had:\n\nPros\n\n- iPhone 4 has a nice sleek design, shaped flat on the back, as opposed to the last iphone I had which was rounded on the back\n- Faster than the last 2 iPhones I had (2G & 3G)\n- Fits most modern cases (Mine is the Ariza Imperial case which Amazon sells - Ariza Imperial iPhone 4 / 4S -Leaux Comfort Case with Genuine Leather -Gold / Black)\n- Great with the latest IOS\n- App Store, iTunes, Podcast, & Overall High Quality\n\nCons\n- Small Device vs most larger screens of today\n- No FREE MUSIC apps (Unless iPhone is jailbroken)\n- Less Free Apps than Android\n- Not an Android Phone :)\n\nOverall, I never had issues with my iPhone 4, but often dropped my phone due to my clumsiness, so I purchased an Ariza Imperial case to protect my phone and also look like a million bucks.\nAnyone interested, you can find this case here Ariza Imperial iPhone 4 / 4S -Leaux Comfort Case with Genuine Leather -Gold / Black\n\nI loved my old iPhone 4 but I liked Android even better :)\nThe iPhone 4 is great for those who like its style, but I am more into having a mini sized PC in my pocket with free apps and free music :)",

            "text": "Having been an Apple fan since I was very young, I was excited when I finally acquired enough money to purchase the iPhone 4. I have been use to the OS of Apple for many years, as I have had a Mac computer at home, and an iPod touch since I was in 9th grade (I am now a senior). The interface was very easy for me to use, considering my experience. The OS is exactly the same as my iPod touch- the only difference being that it could now call and text people without the use of Wifi! I was thrilled. There are, as with any phone, flaws and improvements. One, that I was somewhat disappointed with, is that this phone does not have speech-to-text, which I found very useful on my old android phone. Obviously, this issue has been fixed with the iPhone 4s, which has Siri to type messages for you, but my thought was, \"Why in the world did Apple not include this feature when the very simplest of android phones have it?\" Stil, it does not deter from my love for the phone itself. The second thing that I find slightly annoying is that, without turning the phone on silent, there is absolutely no way to just have your text alerts on vibrate. The third problem with this phone is it's durability aspect. In other words, if you drop it on anything harder than your big toe, the screen shatters and you're out 30 bucks. A nice, durable case, made by many different companies (otterbox, incipio, lifeproof) make very durable cases that can be purchased at a discounted price right here on amazon! Most of these cases get great reviews, although they do make the phone a little bulky. The most important think is to get a case that had a small lip over the screen of the phone so that, if dropped, the phone never lands directly on the screen.\n\nIn other, happier news, this phone had a stunning display. Images, videos, icons, everything is nice and crisp. The screen has a higher resolution than most other Apple products (i.e. older versions of the iPhone, and iPod touch). Opening applications is fast and very responsive. The screen itself responds almost immediately with very little to no lag. Browsing the web can be tricky, as you don't have the usual options as other phones, and it takes a while to acquaint yourself with the differences. The camera on the back is very good. I have found that, although images may not look as crisp and clean as say the Samsung Galaxy SIII, they are about the next best thing. The flash is very bright, and very useful in dark places. The front camera does have some distortion, make sure you have plenty of light in order to use that camera. If you are not familiar with the Apple secrets (double tap zoom, touch the screen in camera mode to adjust light exposure, three finger double tap on home and lock screen to zoom, etc.), I would suggest investing in an app that will tell you those things.\n\nCall quality is very good. The keyboard use is very responsive- I finally have a touch-screen phone that can keep up with my fingers! Text messaging is a breeze, and games are very crisp. The best thing for me about this phone is the memory. I love that I don't have to worry about the internal memory getting too low. The battery is very good, lasting all day or more with minimal use. As ever, Apple's music playing capabilities has blown me away! As i have said before, I am very use to the Apple interface- itunes, the ipod (music) app, the way videos playback- thus playing music on this device is like returning home after a long trip. Apple has done a great job with this phone, and I can't wait for the next line of apple products that are sure to take the cake!",

But let's face it: Apple Products rock!\n\nNot everything is perfect; I have issues with the Apple TV, but am still waiting to see the hobby device become something serious.\n\nBut the iPhone 4S lives up to its promise in many ways.\n\n If I could advise you on one thing about this phone it's this: get as much space as you can afford. Yes there is iCloud, but it's not even close to it's potential. Also, if you're like me and use streaming music services, you'll want the space for travelling without a network (like on a plane). Not to mention all of the beautiful pictures you'll take with the awesome camera this has built in! I do not take my standalone digital camera with me anymore. It just doesn't compare. And, bonus, my pics automagically get shoved up into iCloud so I can share them with all of my other Mac devices (yes including the Apple TV). Siri is in beta, but just about every time I talk to her, she really hears me and puts down my words in writing.\n\nThe other thing about the iPhone that most folks don't know is that the software running it is alot older than you think. Sure the interface itself (where you touch the screen) is all new. But underneath it all is an Operating System built from the Mac OS X bits and pieces that are matured from as long ago as 1993. I know because I worked with that OS (NeXTStep) back then (both as a developer and user).\n\nI see Android devices catching up, but I'm confident that Apple will just leapfrog over whatever they put out. In the meantime, I have a phone that does everything I want, with a consistent look and feel and the elegance of a well thought out and designed operating system.\n\nNow as far as Verizon goes. Yes, it's still 3G. If you don't like that, wait for the iPhone 5, it'll be LTE by then. It actually doesn't bother me that much. I also grab wifi when I'm in a stable place. But out and about I've rarely noticed a loss of data nor dropped phone calls. I can't say I could compare this to AT or any other carrier for that matter as this is my first iPhone 4(S).\n\nIf you're thinking about this phone, can afford the voice and data plan, just get the most amount of space you can afford and you can't go wrong.",

The thing I use it for are notes, calling,games time,internet, music and I could go on and on but I'll stop.the camera has a great space to keep all of your photos in one safe spot that anyone can trust.It is super portabal with the internet it fast and wont keep you waiting.It has all the same bell's and whisile's as the 5,5s,5c.

It turns out that the brightness was fully on. The phone was on and working, but the brightness wasn't working. I could only see a little of the screen in front of a light. I'm not impressed about the upgrade as much as I was before. Here's the good news,I can probably get it fixed when the next upgrade comes out. The bad news is,the next upgrade is in January of next year. I think that it is a good product overall.\n\n The product is an IPhone 4. It costs about $100 to about $500 dollars.

            "text": "May 6, 2012.\n\nI recently switched from a HTC Desire (Google Android) to an iPhone 4S, and I have finally got to experience what the fuss is all about. Firstly it's a beautiful phone, both externally, and in terms of interface. Everything is gorgeous, smooth moving, and clean looking. The interface never becomes jerky or slow, unlike with my Desire, and although that sounds like a minor thing, it actually makes a huge amount of difference: Just using the phone is enjoyable, everything feels really \"solid\".\n\nThe keyboard is also FAR improved to the one I had to suffer with for two years on my HTC Desire. I've only had my iPhone a few days and I'm already a fast typer than I ever was with that phone. Well done, Apple!\n\nThat said, there are few things that my HTC Desire did better:\n\n1. The Desire came with an LED indicator that would flash green if I had any updates. That meant that I could glance at my phone across the room and see if I had any texts, missed calls, emails, Facebook updates, etc. It was very handy. The iPhone 4S has a feature to use its flash in a similar manner, but it actually only flashes the instant you receive a text or email. Then it stops, meaning it's pretty useless.\n\n2. The Desire came with a way to control the cursor. The \"home\" button on that phone also detected finger movement. If I was typing something and I wanted to go back a few characters, I could just move my thumb across it, and control the flashing cursor between the letters. It was extremely useful and I find myself trying to do it on the iPhone. Unfortunately on the iPhone all you can do is hold your finger on the screen and drag the cursor to where you want it to be (you also had this option on the Desire, but I never used it because the other way was far more efficient). It's a little glitchy and a lot slower. Shame.\n\n3. When I wanted to search the internet for something with my HTC Desire, I could just press the \"Search\" button on the case. It was quick and intuitive. On the iPhone it's astonishingly laborious: You must go into the web browser and select the \"Google\" bar on the top right hand corner of the screen. It's not THAT bad, however, because there's a shortcut that allows you to zip up to the top of the screen.\n\n4. Although the scrolling is wonderfully smooth on the iPhone (certainly smoother than the Desire was), it's a lot slower. On my Desire I could \"flick\" the screen with my finger and it would keep scrolling on its own, with its own inertia (it would eventually slow down depending on how fast I had \"flicked\" it). This was fantastic when all you want to do is check for new comments on a blog post. You could quickly and easily scroll down to the bottom of a page, without any finger strain.\n\nOn the iPhone the scrolling stops soon after you let go, making navigating long pages a very arduous experience indeed.\n\n5. On top of the lack of an LED indicator, the iPhone is also lacking with regards to keeping you informed of updates. On my HTC Desire there would be an icon at the top of the screen, no matter what I was doing, letting me know if I had any updates. A different icon for each update: An email, a text message, a missed call, a Facebook update, a new Twitter message, etc.\n\nOn the iPhone you get informed, but then it's gone. It's hard to explain how this isn't as good as the Android equivalent, and I understand that it probably sounds minor to those who have never used an Android phone.\n\nUpdate: I've actually gotten used the Apple way of doing things, so while it may jar for those who move across, chances are you'll adapt like I have.\n\n6. One of the best Apps on the Android is a free one called \"FoxyRing\". It has a terrible name, but it's brilliant: It automatically adjusts your ring/notification volume for you, depending on the loudness of the ambient sound around you. Just walked into a Library? It will turn the volume down for you. In the middle of a gig? It will turn it up for you. All done automatically. You can also set it so that your phone automatically goes to silent at a given time, every evening (say 11pm) and goes back to normal (i.e. automatically adjusting your volume) at 8am. In other words, I never had to worry about my phone's volume, it was just taken care of.\n\nSadly Apple do not allow Apps to have this sort of control, and they don't have the equivalent system built in to their OS. It's a real shame because I think it will eventually become standard in the future for people not to have to worry about their phone's volume.\n\nAnyways, this is a minor concern, because a lot of people won't have that particular App.\n\nSo ultimately, while there are flaws with this phone, they don't ruin the experience. It's a little shocking to me, as a new user, that Apple has seen fit to focus their attention on gimmicks like \"Siri\" (I don't know anyone who really makes use of it), when there are could be some great improvements made to the interface.\n\nWould I go back to an Android? Nope. At least, not right now. The experience on the iPhone, however frustratingly idiosyncratic at times, is still an enjoyable one. The little graphical touches, the slickness of the presentation, and the simplicity of use, all make it really satisfying. After the many quirks of my Android phone, it's really nice to have a phone \"that just works\". It may not do exactly what you want it to do, but what it does do, it does extremely well.\n\nFinal note: Be prepared to spend a bit extra on a case and/or screen protector. Not only is the iPhone notoriously fragile and prone to smashing if dropped (I know about five people with cracked screens), it's also pretty slippery in your hand compared to other phones. A rubber case will make it less likely to take a tumble out of your hand, and a screen protector will keep that glass screen scratch free. It's an unfortunate hidden cost, in my opinion.\n\nAdditional note: If you're an Android user, you may also be shocked to discover how lacklustre Apple's support for Facebook and GMail are. Both of these apps are not as good as their Android counterparts at the time of writing, and there's no way to \"link\" phone numbers to Facebook accounts. Another annoying, but minor, quirk of the iPhone to be aware of.",

Since I still have almost a year left on my plan, I had to start shopping for a new phone. Thank god for Amazon - the price of this phone is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThe first iPhone 4 I purchased worked great for the first week but then the light sensor went out. (When you're on a phone call, the screen usually goes black so you don't dial anything with your cheek. .. this one didn't work like that, the screen never went black.) I returned this product and purchased another one. Amazon was great with the prepaid return label and the quick refund.\n\nThe second iPhone 4 I purchased works perfectly! The only thing I notice is that it is a tad slower than what I'm used to but that is to be expected with the older operating system.\n\nI would definitely recommend purchasing a phone from Amazon. If the first one doesn't work out, try again. These phones are refurbished so you might have to try a few times to get a perfect one but the price makes it worth it. Much better than purchasing a brand new iPhone for $700.",

            "text": "Over the weekend I got the Apple iPhone 4, and decided to go through Verizon. I was on straight talk and had an Ascend 2. I wanted to switch earlier, but just didn't have the funds. So being that the iPhone 4 was free, all I had to pay was 125 dollar desposit,and after that get a case since I have had previous bad luck dropping the phone. I like the over all design and lets be honest even though this thing is a 3G phone is still great. It's incredibly responsive. I have mine in a case but the touch pad is just right. I am tall and have long fingers. I need a big keyboard and the iPhone 4's keypad is plenty big for my fingers. Occasionally auto correct has me going back to correct a few things but its not nearly as bad as my previous phones with cricket/straight talk.\n\nBy the way for anybody who has Straight talk let me just say that I'm in no way discouraging you from Straight talk. I was in a position to either buy a phone outright and pay the 49 to continue my service, or get a free phone and maybe pay a little more for luxury I hadn't previously had. I didn't have the 600 bucks for an expensive phone so I went with this phone. I'm going to be stuck with it for 2 years, but the way I see it is this. I love the phone. A lot of friends and even my brother do not like Apple, or the iPhone craze, or the perceived craze. But it works for what I need and that is the most important thing.\n\nI would definitely recommend the iPhone 4 to anybody who wants to give it a trial run. I fell in love with his little phone and I don't see why anybody else wouldn't. I'm on the 2GB plan and so far its all I need. Should I need more I'll adjust it. But as of right now I'm very happy with my new phone and also the switch to Verizon.\n\nSo when you look at it from a perspective of what you need it works. Doesn't make you obnoxious for having an iPhone. Just maybe that you were a little curious. You decided to try and maybe you'll fall in love with his model. While itunes is great. Haven't used it yet. But I like it for everything else.\n\nGive it a try and maybe you'll surprise yourself. Happy hunting, and good luck with whatever you decide.",

I ordered it on a Friday & as usual, I cheap out on the rush shipping so I took my chances with standard shipping. Although the expected delivery date was the following Thursday, I noticed that they shipped it out that day & I had it in my hands by Monday, yay! I've been using my spare phone for a few days after my Droid 2 crashed so I was so excited to get this phone. The packaging left more to be desired but the phone is in dang near perfect condition, looked brand new! It was charged about 75% so I was able to activate it right away on my prepaid service without any problems. I've been using it all day since 3PM & all seems to be fine. Only minor issue, which I hope don't turn in to a big issue is that sometimes, there is a lag in the response on the touch screen. I don't know if that's how all phones are as my Droids also lagged but I will keep an eye out in case it gets worse.\n\nSUMMARY: I received a great product, exactly as described. Exceptionally fast shipping. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great quality refurbished phone.",

I carried a Droid for a few years and it had been choking for several months. I have a work iPad and itouch and they have always been very smooth in operation. This iPhone 4 seems to be the same. I am not sure what market this phone was made for because the language was set for Chinese when I first powered it up. The USB cord seems a little cheese compared to the cord that came with the itouch. The Verizon store activated the phone with no issues. The spell check is far superior to the Droid and it does not reboot at will like the Droid did. The phone has been on for about 36 hours with light use and the battery is currently at 30%. The box did not come warped in cellophane like it would have if purchased from the Verizon store.\nI would buy another one from this vendor if needed. Should I have any issues I will update the review.",

So if you want a FREE phone, I would still say pay extra to get a later generation because eventually, this will be too slow to handle new apps.\n\nI noticed that Amazon will buy back the three different models almost reflects the difference for ordering a new phone from Verizon with a new 2 year contract e.g. if the 4 is free with new contract, the best offer from Verizon is $125 and so if the 5 is $200 from Verizon, then the best offer from Amazon is $335. The iphones still have better resale value than other smartphones although all are in the $200 range for the newest phones. This may be something to consider when choosing a phone.\n\nThe battery takes about one hour to become fully charged.

Here is the breakdown.\n\nPros\n+Phone works flawless\n+No lost calls\n+Clear screen\n+Good lighting\n+Light\n+Thin\n\nCons\n-Entire thing is made of glass! I broke mine the first day! And I am very very very careful about things that are fragile. Life happened and I dropped it because it slipped off my lap, 1 foot drop at best. Front smashed in, no longer could use it.\n-Had to buy replace screen (icracked 65 dollars, dont use them they are terrible also) screen now works but has lines through it and black patch marks on it. Takes away from the picture, and it was insane to fix in the first place. For apple to fix, it will cost you 200 dollars.\n-Had to buy a case for the phone, a tough as nails case from Otter Box (they are good) cost 60 bucks.\n-Because of the case (which you WILL need) now the phone is bulky and no longer thin.\n-Insurance for the phone with verizon is insane at price, 15 dollars a month forever. And if you break it you still have to pay 150 out of pocket to replace!\n\nAll in all, the phone itself works great. But what is holding the phone together is pure trash and a gimmick to get you to buy more stuff. Free phone really means Phone Upgrade $30 + Phone Case $60 + Phone screen replace $65= $155 dollar free phone. I will never buy from apple or this phone again. Stay away from unless you want to carry around a fragile phone all day and fear of it breaking, ever drop your phone?",

I went to Apple earlier this afternoon and they basically told me It was a scam, and I was sent the wrong phone. Not a Verizon phone, like the packaging described, an AT phone. I would rate this experience very low. I am upset to have to send back a brand new slick phone that I was so excited to recieve in the first place.",

In places I used to get 4 or 5 bars with my old LG phone, I get 1 or 2 bars with the iphone until I try to connect and it drops out. The call quality is abysmal compared to the old LG phone when the signal is less than 3 bars. I've tried the silicone ring around the edges as suggested for the early iphones with minimal results. It does everything but act like a good phone. Another annoyance is the touch screen has no adjustment; unless you use a (special) stylus or have very skinny fingers, touching the screen may take you somewhere you don't intend and for many menus there is no simple single step back to correct the mistake. It certainly doesn't live up to all of the hype; it is basically an ipod that may work as a phone if you have a good signal. Another dubious feature is virtual signal strength bars. Before dialing it will show 5 bars only to drop to one as soon as it tries to connect.\nUpdate: The iphone died so that I cannot hear if I hold it up to my ear just after the warranty expired! I tried everything I could find on line to reset it; now it only is functional with a Bluetooth, wired hands free device or the terrible sounding speaker phone option; a major inconvenience. I'm anything but impressed by the lack of quality and poor ergonomics. I cannot believe the number of lemming like people that cannot wait to spend too much money for the latest crap from Apple; count me out from ever sending any of my hard earned money their way. I wish I could give it zero stars.",
