('Processing text: ', u"I just plugged this baby into my computer and it installed itself and worked great. I have done many GoToMeetings with this and it works flawlessly every time. It was a great addition to my Plantronics headset.This device cannot be avoided. Teleworks get a mike-off switch, volume control, quick-cord-separation device, and very sturdy electrical cord. Expensive but made for reliable use.I purchased this for the H51 Supra Monaural Tube Headset. This is fantastic. It works with both the system software, but also with other software I was not sure of. Purchased because of some specific software my company uses, this works for all audio conferencing software I have to use, even with different clients' systems.Have used Plantronics headsets for many years. Needed a microphone on a workstation. This adapter works as described with my headset.PC (Win7) detected and picked it right up, I use it daily for work along with a Platronics HW251N and it works flawlessly, what more to sayEasy to install with vendor headset and it works. Even music sounds better - although I use it mainly for phone calls.Bought this to use with my Plantronics headset for my work from home system. Installed fine with the built in Windows 7 drivers on a company computer without requiring admin rights. No documentation in the box; there was a CD but I didn't mess with it. One button to mute (lights up and chirps when muted), rocker to change volume, another button that I couldn't figure out the purpose of, but doesn't affect how it works (but see update below).\n\nCould have gotten a gaming headset, probably should have, but if I'm going to wear this for ten hours while working, would rather have the one I'm used to.\n\nUpdate: The extra button, that looks like a one-eared headset, is to allow you to answer a call on a softphone without having to click on anything on the computer. It requires the software to be installed, though, which I haven't bothered with.Works fine and I guess I would have to say I cheated in that my company had bought me one for business use so when\nneeded one for home use I went with what I know works. Also the service I got from Amazon Marketplace's DataVision\nwas way better than I had expected.This thing is really nice for the professional use: My telephone, BB and laptop is compatible, and I can have phone meetings for hours.\n\nOnnly drawback: Listening to music is horrible with it! The sound is tinny. Must be a SW issue, I keep digging in to solve this.The mute button stopped working shortly after it was received. Customer may not have original box to return product. Can product still be returned for replacement?This item is what I needed and wanted and does just what I need it to do. The item got to me in a reasonable amount of time and in good condition.")
