text: I just plugged this baby into my computer and it installed itself and worked great. I have done many GoToMeetings with this and it works flawlessly every time. It was a great addition to my Plantronics headset.

text: This device cannot be avoided. Teleworks get a mike-off switch, volume control, quick-cord-separation device, and very sturdy electrical cord. Expensive but made for reliable use.

text: I purchased this for the H51 Supra Monaural Tube Headset. This is fantastic. It works with both the system software, but also with other software I was not sure of. Purchased because of some specific software my company uses, this works for all audio conferencing software I have to use, even with different clients' systems.

text: PC (Win7) detected and picked it right up, I use it daily for work along with a Platronics HW251N and it works flawlessly, what more to say

text: Easy to install with vendor headset and it works. Even music sounds better - although I use it mainly for phone calls.

text: Bought this to use with my Plantronics headset for my work from home system. Installed fine with the built in Windows 7 drivers on a company computer without requiring admin rights. No documentation in the box; there was a CD but I didn't mess with it. One button to mute (lights up and chirps when muted), rocker to change volume, another button that I couldn't figure out the purpose of, but doesn't affect how it works (but see update below).

Could have gotten a gaming headset, probably should have, but if I'm going to wear this for ten hours while working, would rather have the one I'm used to.

Update: The extra button, that looks like a one-eared headset, is to allow you to answer a call on a softphone without having to click on anything on the computer. It requires the software to be installed, though, which I haven't bothered with.

text: Works fine and I guess I would have to say I cheated in that my company had bought me one for business use so when
needed one for home use I went with what I know works. Also the service I got from Amazon Marketplace's DataVision
was way better than I had expected.

text: This thing is really nice for the professional use: My telephone, BB and laptop is compatible, and I can have phone meetings for hours.

Onnly drawback: Listening to music is horrible with it! The sound is tinny. Must be a SW issue, I keep digging in to solve this.
